      "Text: The following is a conversation with Andrew Ng, one of the most impactful educators, researchers, innovators, and leaders in artificial intelligence and technology space in general. He cofounded Coursera and Google Brain, launched Deep Learning AI, Landing AI, and the AI Fund, and was the chief scientist at Baidu. As a Stanford professor and with Coursera and Deep Learning AI, he has helped educate and inspire millions of students, including me. This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast. If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube, give it five stars on Apple Podcast, support it on Patreon, or simply connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N. As usual, I'll do one or two minutes of ads now and never any ads in the middle that can break the flow of the conversation. I hope that works for you and doesn't hurt the listening experience. This show is presented by Cash App, the number one finance app in the App Store. When you get it, use code LEXPODCAST. Cash App lets you send money to friends, buy Bitcoin, and invest in the stock market with as little as $1. Broker services are provided by Cash App Investing, a subsidiary of Square, a member SIPC. Since Cash App allows you to buy Bitcoin, let me mention that cryptocurrency in the context of the history of money is fascinating. I recommend Ascent of Money as a great book on this history. Debits and credits on ledgers started over 30,000 years ago. The US dollar was created over 200 years ago, and Bitcoin, the first decentralized cryptocurrency, released just over 10 years ago. So given that history, cryptocurrency is still very much in its early days of development, but it's still aiming to and just might redefine the nature of money. So again, if you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play and use the code LEXPODCAST, you'll get $10, and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST, one of my favorite organizations that is helping to advance robotics and STEM education for young people around the world. And now, here's my conversation with Andrew Ng. The courses you taught on machine learning at Stanford and later on Coursera that you cofounded have educated and inspired millions of people. So let me ask you, what people or ideas inspired you to get into computer science and machine learning when you were young? When did you first fall in love with the field, is another way to put it. Growing up in Hong Kong and Singapore, I started learning to code when I was five or six years old. At that time, I was learning the basic programming language, and they would take these books and they'll tell you, type this program into your computer, so type that program to my computer. And as a result of all that typing, I would get to play these very simple shoot them up games that I had implemented on my little computer. So I thought it was fascinating as a young kid that I could write this code. I was really just copying code from a book into my computer to then play these cool little video games. Another moment for me was when I was a teenager and my father, who's a doctor, was reading about expert systems and about neural networks. So he got me to read some of these books, and I thought it was really cool. You could write a computer that started to exhibit intelligence. Then I remember doing an internship while I was in high school, this was in Singapore, where I remember doing a lot of photocopying and as an office assistant. And the highlight of my job was when I got to use the shredder. So the teenager me, remote thinking, boy, this is a lot of photocopying. If only we could write software, build a robot, something to automate this, maybe I could do something else. So I think a lot of my work since then has centered on the theme of automation. Even the way I think about machine learning today, we're very good at writing learning algorithms that can automate things that people can do. Or even launching the first MOOCs, Mass Open Online Courses, that later led to Coursera. I was trying to automate what could be automatable in how I was teaching on campus. Process of education, trying to automate parts of that to make it more, sort of to have more impact from a single teacher, a single educator. Yeah, I felt, you know, teaching at Stanford, teaching machine learning to about 400 students a year at the time. And I found myself filming the exact same video every year, telling the same jokes in the same room. And I thought, why am I doing this? Why don't we just take last year's video? And then I can spend my time building a deeper relationship with students. So that process of thinking through how to do that, that led to the first MOOCs that we launched. And then you have more time to write new jokes. Are there favorite memories from your early days at Stanford, teaching thousands of people in person and then millions of people online? You know, teaching online, what not many people know was that a lot of those videos were shot between the hours of 10 p.m. and 3 a.m. A lot of times, we were launching the first MOOCs at Stanford. We had already announced the course, about 100,000 people signed up. We just started to write the code and we had not yet actually filmed the videos. So a lot of pressure, 100,000 people waiting for us to produce the content. So many Fridays, Saturdays, I would go out, have dinner with my friends, and then I would think, OK, do you want to go home now? Or do you want to go to the office to film videos? And the thought of being able to help 100,000 people potentially learn machine learning, fortunately, that made me think, OK, I want to go to my office, go to my tiny little recording studio. I would adjust my Logitech webcam, adjust my Wacom tablet, make sure my lapel mic was on, and then I would start recording often until 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. I think unfortunately, that doesn't show that it was recorded that late at night, but it was really inspiring the thought that we could create content to help so many people learn about machine learning. How did that feel? The fact that you're probably somewhat alone, maybe a couple of friends recording with a Logitech webcam and kind of going home alone at 1 or 2 a.m. at night and knowing that that's going to reach sort of thousands of people, eventually millions of people, what's that feeling like? I mean, is there a feeling of just satisfaction of pushing through? I think it's humbling. And I wasn't thinking about what I was feeling. I think one thing that I'm proud to say we got right from the early days was I told my whole team back then that the number one priority is to do what's best for learners, do what's best for students. And so when I went to the recording studio, the only thing on my mind was what can I say? How can I design my slides? What I need to draw right to make these concepts as clear as possible for learners? I think I've seen sometimes instructors is tempting to, hey, let's talk about my work. Maybe if I teach you about my research, someone will cite my papers a couple more times. And I think one of the things we got right, launching the first few MOOCs and later building Coursera, was putting in place that bedrock principle of let's just do what's best for learners and forget about everything else. And I think that that is a guiding principle turned out to be really important to the rise of the MOOC movement. And the kind of learner you imagined in your mind is as broad as possible, as global as possible. So really try to reach as many people interested in machine learning and AI as possible. I really want to help anyone that had an interest in machine learning to break into the field. And I think sometimes I've actually had people ask me, hey, why are you spending so much time explaining gradient descent? And my answer was, if I look at what I think the learner needs and what benefit from, I felt that having that a good understanding of the foundations coming back to the basics would put them in a better stead to then build on a long term career. So try to consistently make decisions on that principle. So one of the things you actually revealed to the narrow AI community at the time and to the world is that the amount of people who are actually interested in AI is much larger than we imagined. By you teaching the class and how popular it became, it showed that, wow, this isn't just a small community of sort of people who go to NeurIPS and it's much bigger. It's developers, it's people from all over the world. I mean, I'm Russian, so everybody in Russia is really interested. There's a huge number of programmers who are interested in machine learning, India, China, South America, everywhere. There's just millions of people who are interested in machine learning. So how big do you get a sense that the number of people is that are interested from your perspective? I think the number has grown over time. I think it's one of those things that maybe it feels like it came out of nowhere, but it's an insight that building it, it took years. It's one of those overnight successes that took years to get there. My first foray into this type of online education was when we were filming my Stanford class and sticking the videos on YouTube and some other things. We had uploaded the horrors and so on, but it's basically the one hour, 15 minute video that we put on YouTube. And then we had four or five other versions of websites that I had built, most of which you would never have heard of because they reached small audiences, but that allowed me to iterate, allowed my team and me to iterate, to learn what are the ideas that work and what doesn't. For example, one of the features I was really excited about and really proud of was build this website where multiple people could be logged into the website at the same time. So today, if you go to a website, if you are logged in and then I want to log in, you need to log out because it's the same browser, the same computer. But I thought, well, what if two people say you and me were watching a video together in front of a computer? What if a website could have you type your name and password, have me type my name and password, and then now the computer knows both of us are watching together and it gives both of us credit for anything we do as a group. Influencers feature rolled it out in a high school in San Francisco. We had about 20 something users. Where's the teacher there? Sacred Heart Cathedral Prep, the teacher is great. I mean, guess what? Zero people use this feature. It turns out people studying online, they want to watch the videos by themselves. So you can play back, pause at your own speed rather than in groups. So that was one example of a tiny lesson learned out of many that allowed us to hone into the set of features. It sounds like a brilliant feature. So I guess the lesson to take from that is there's something that looks amazing on paper and then nobody uses it. It doesn't actually have the impact that you think it might have. And so, yeah, I saw that you really went through a lot of different features and a lot of ideas to arrive at Coursera, the final kind of powerful thing that showed the world that MOOCs can educate millions. And I think with the whole machine learning movement as well, I think it didn't come out of nowhere. Instead, what happened was as more people learn about machine learning, they will tell their friends and their friends will see how it's applicable to their work. And then the community kept on growing. And I think we're still growing. I don't know in the future what percentage of all developers will be AI developers. I could easily see it being north of 50%, right? Because so many AI developers broadly construed, not just people doing the machine learning modeling, but the people building infrastructure, data pipelines, all the software surrounding the core machine learning model maybe is even bigger. I feel like today almost every software engineer has some understanding of the cloud. Not all, but maybe this is my microcontroller developer that doesn't need to deal with the cloud. But I feel like the vast majority of software engineers today are sort of having an appreciation of the cloud. I think in the future, maybe we'll approach nearly 100% of all developers being in some way an AI developer or at least having an appreciation of machine learning. And my hope is that there's this kind of effect that there's people who are not really interested in being a programmer or being into software engineering, like biologists, chemists, and physicists, even mechanical engineers, all these disciplines that are now more and more sitting on large data sets. And here they didn't think they're interested in programming until they have this data set and they realize there's this set of machine learning tools that allow you to use the data set. So they actually become, they learn to program and they become new programmers. So like the, not just because you've mentioned a larger percentage of developers become machine learning people. So it seems like more and more the kinds of people who are becoming developers is also growing significantly. Yeah, I think once upon a time, only a small part of humanity was literate, could read and write. And maybe you thought, maybe not everyone needs to learn to read and write. You just go listen to a few monks read to you and maybe that was enough. Or maybe you just need a few handful of authors to write the bestsellers and no one else needs to write. But what we found was that by giving as many people, in some countries, almost everyone, basic literacy, it dramatically enhanced human to human communications. And we can now write for an audience of one, such as if I send you an email or you send me an email. I think in computing, we're still in that phase where so few people know how to code that the coders mostly have to code for relatively large audiences. But if everyone, or most people became developers at some level, similar to how most people in developed economies are somewhat literate, I would love to see the owners of a mom and pop store be able to write a little bit of code to customize the TV display for their special this week. And I think it will enhance human to computer communications, which is becoming more and more important today as well. So you think it's possible that machine learning becomes kind of similar to literacy, where like you said, the owners of a mom and pop shop, is basically everybody in all walks of life would have some degree of programming capability? I could see society getting there. There's one other interesting thing. If I go talk to the mom and pop store, if I talk to a lot of people in their daily professions, I previously didn't have a good story for why they should learn to code. We could give them some reasons. But what I found with the rise of machine learning and data science is that I think the number of people with a concrete use for data science in their daily lives, in their jobs, may be even larger than the number of people who have concrete use for software engineering. For example, if you run a small mom and pop store, I think if you can analyze the data about your sales, your customers, I think there's actually real value there, maybe even more than traditional software engineering. So I find that for a lot of my friends in various professions, be it recruiters or accountants or people that work in the factories, which I deal with more and more these days, I feel if they were data scientists at some level, they could immediately use that in their work. So I think that data science and machine learning may be an even easier entree into the developer world for a lot of people than the software engineering. That's interesting. And I agree with that, but that's beautifully put. But we live in a world where most courses and talks have slides, PowerPoint, keynote, and yet you famously often still use a marker and a whiteboard. The simplicity of that is compelling, and for me at least, fun to watch. So let me ask, why do you like using a marker and whiteboard, even on the biggest of stages? I think it depends on the concepts you want to explain. For mathematical concepts, it's nice to build up the equation one piece at a time, and the whiteboard marker or the pen and stylus is a very easy way to build up the equation, to build up a complex concept one piece at a time while you're talking about it, and sometimes that enhances understandability. The downside of writing is that it's slow, and so if you want a long sentence, it's very hard to write that. So I think there are pros and cons, and sometimes I use slides, and sometimes I use a whiteboard or a stylus. The slowness of a whiteboard is also its upside, because it forces you to reduce everything to the basics. Some of your talks involve the whiteboard. I mean, you go very slowly, and you really focus on the most simple principles, and that's a beautiful, that enforces a kind of a minimalism of ideas that I think is surprising at least for me is great for education. Like a great talk, I think, is not one that has a lot of content. A great talk is one that just clearly says a few simple ideas, and I think the whiteboard somehow enforces that. Peter Abbeel, who's now one of the top roboticists and reinforcement learning experts in the world, was your first PhD student. So I bring him up just because I kind of imagine this must have been an interesting time in your life, and do you have any favorite memories of working with Peter, since you were your first student in those uncertain times, especially before deep learning really sort of blew up? Any favorite memories from those times? Yeah, I was really fortunate to have had Peter Abbeel as my first PhD student, and I think even my long term professional success builds on early foundations or early work that Peter was so critical to. So I was really grateful to him for working with me. What not a lot of people know is just how hard research was, and still is. Peter's PhD thesis was using reinforcement learning to fly helicopters. And so, even today, the website heli.stanford.edu, heli.stanford.edu is still up. You can watch videos of us using reinforcement learning to make a helicopter fly upside down, fly loose roses, so it's cool. It's one of the most incredible robotics videos ever, so people should watch it. Oh yeah, thank you. It's inspiring. That's from like 2008 or seven or six, like that range. Yeah, something like that. Yeah, so it was over 10 years old. That was really inspiring to a lot of people, yeah. What not many people see is how hard it was. So Peter and Adam Coase and Morgan Quigley and I were working on various versions of the helicopter, and a lot of things did not work. For example, it turns out one of the hardest problems we had was when the helicopter's flying around upside down, doing stunts, how do you figure out the position? How do you localize the helicopter? So we wanted to try all sorts of things. Having one GPS unit doesn't work because you're flying upside down, the GPS unit's facing down, so you can't see the satellites. So we experimented trying to have two GPS units, one facing up, one facing down. So if you flip over, that didn't work because the downward facing one couldn't synchronize if you're flipping quickly. Morgan Quigley was exploring this crazy, complicated configuration of specialized hardware like Google, Facebook, Baidu all these large sort of companies that already have huge teams of machine learning engineers you can also do with an industry sort of more research groups that kind of like Google Research, Google Brain then you can also do like we said a professor in academia and what else oh you can build your own company you can do a startup is there anything that stands out between those options or are they all beautiful different journeys that people should consider I think the thing that affects your experience more is less are you in this company versus that company or academia versus industry I think the thing that affects your experience most is who are the people you're interacting with in a daily basis so even if you look at some of the large companies the experience of individuals in different teams is very different and what matters most is not the logo above the door when you walk into the giant building every day what matters the most is who are the 10 people who are the 30 people you interact with every day so I actually tend to advise people if you get a job from a company ask who is your manager who are your peers who are you actually going to talk to we're all social creatures we tend to become more like the people around us and if you're working with great people you will learn faster or if you get admitted if you get a job at a great company or a great university maybe the logo you walk in is great but you're actually stuck on some team doing really work that doesn't excite you and then that's actually a really bad experience so this is true both for universities and for large companies for small companies you can kind of figure out who you'll be working with quite quickly and I tend to advise people if a company refuses to tell you who you will work with someone say oh join us the rotation system will figure it out I think that that's a worrying answer because it because it means you may not get sent to you may not actually get to a team with great peers and great people to work with it's actually a really profound advice that we kind of sometimes sweep we don't consider too rigorously or carefully the people around you are really often especially when you accomplish great things it seems the great things are accomplished because of the people around you so that's a it's not about the the where whether you learn this thing or that thing or like you said the logo that hangs up top it's the people that's a fascinating and it's such a hard search process of finding just like finding the right friends and somebody to get married with and that kind of thing it's a very hard search it's a people search problem yeah but I think when someone interviews you know at a university or the research lab or the large corporation it's good to insist on just asking who are the people who is my manager and if you refuse to tell me I'm gonna think well maybe that's because you don't have a good answer it may not be someone I like and if you don't particularly connect if something feels off with the people then don't stick to it you know that's a really important signal to consider yeah yeah and actually I actually in my standard class CS230 as well as an ACM talk I think I gave like a hour long talk on career advice including on the job search process and then some of these so you can find those videos online awesome and I'll point them I'll point people to them beautiful so the AI fund helps AI startups get off the ground or perhaps you can elaborate on all the fun things it's involved with what's your advice and how does one build a successful AI startup you know in Silicon Valley a lot of startup failures come from building other products that no one wanted so when you know cool technology but who's going to use it so I think I tend to be very outcome driven and customer obsessed ultimately we don't get to vote if we succeed or fail it's only the customer that they're the only one that gets a thumbs up or thumbs down vote in the long term in the short term you know there are various people that get various votes but in the long term that's what really matters so as you build the startup you have to constantly ask the question will the customer give a thumbs up on this I think so I think startups that are very customer focused customer obsessed deeply understand the customer and are oriented to serve the customer are more likely to succeed with the provisional I think all of us should only do things that we think create social good and moves the world forward so I personally don't want to build addictive digital products just to sell a lot of ads or you know there are things that could be lucrative that I won't do but if we can find ways to serve people in meaningful ways I think those can be great things to do either in the academic setting or in a corporate setting or a startup setting so can you give me the idea of why you started the AI fund I remember when I was leading the AI group at Baidu I had two jobs two parts of my job one was to build an AI engine to support the existing businesses and that was running just ran just performed by itself there was a second part of my job at the time which was to try to systematically initiate new lines of businesses using the company's AI capabilities so you know the self driving car team came out of my group the smart speaker team similar to what is Amazon Echo Alexa in the US but we actually announced it before Amazon did so Baidu wasn't following Amazon that came out of my group and I found that to be actually the most fun part of my job so what I wanted to do was to build AI fund as a startup studio to systematically create new startups from scratch with all the things we can now do with AI I think the ability to build new teams to go after this rich space of opportunities is a very important way to very important mechanism to get these projects done that I think will move the world forward so I've been fortunate to build a few teams that had a meaningful positive impact and I felt that we might be able to do this in a more systematic repeatable way so a startup studio is a relatively new concept there are maybe dozens of startup studios you know right now but I feel like all of us many teams are still trying to figure out how do you systematically build companies with a high success rate so I think even a lot of my you know venture capital friends are seem to be more and more building companies rather than investing in companies but I find a fascinating thing to do to figure out the mechanisms by which we could systematically build successful teams, successful businesses in areas that we find meaningful so a startup studio is something is a place and a mechanism for startups to go from zero to success to try to develop a blueprint it's actually a place for us to build startups from scratch so we often bring in founders and work with them or maybe even have existing ideas that we match founders with and then this launches you know hopefully into successful companies so how close are you to figuring out a way to automate the process of starting from scratch and building a successful AI startup yeah I think we've been constantly improving and iterating on our processes how we do that so things like you know how many customer calls do we need to make in order to get customer validation how do we make sure this technology can be built quite a lot of our businesses need cutting edge machine learning algorithms so you know kind of algorithms have developed in the last one or two years and even if it works in a research paper it turns out taking the production is really hard there are a lot of issues for making these things work in the real life that are not widely addressed in academia so how do we validate that this is actually doable how do you build a team get the specialized domain knowledge be it in education or health care whatever sector we're focusing on so I think we've actually getting we've been getting much better at giving the entrepreneurs a high success rate but I think we're still I think the whole world is still in the early phases of figuring this out but do you think there is some aspects of that process that are transferable from one startup to another to another to another yeah very much so you know starting from scratch you know starting a company to most entrepreneurs is a really lonely thing and I've seen so many entrepreneurs not know how to make certain decisions like when do you need to how do you do B2B sales right if you don't know that it's really hard or how do you market this efficiently other than you know buying ads which is really expensive are there more efficient tactics for that or for a machine learning project you know basic decisions can change the course of whether machine learning product works or not and so there are so many hundreds of decisions that entrepreneurs need to make and making a mistake and a couple key decisions can have a huge impact on the fate of the company so I think a startup studio provides a support structure that makes starting a company much less of a lonely experience and also when facing with these key decisions like trying to hire your first uh the VP of engineering what's a good selection criteria how do you solve should I hire this person or not by helping by having a ecosystem around the entrepreneurs the founders to help I think we help them at the key moments and hopefully significantly make them more enjoyable and then higher success rate so there's somebody to brainstorm with in these very difficult decision points and also to help them recognize what they may not even realize is a key decision point that's that's the first and probably the most important part yeah actually I can say one other thing um you know I think building companies is one thing but I feel like it's really important that we build companies that move the world forward for example within the AI Fund team there was once an idea for a new company that if it had succeeded would have resulted in people watching a lot more videos in a certain narrow vertical type of video um I looked at it the business case was fine the revenue case was fine but I looked and just said I don't want to do this like you know I don't actually just want to have a lot more people watch this type of video wasn't educational it's an educational baby and so and so I I I I code the idea on the basis that I didn't think it would actually help people so um whether building companies or working enterprises or doing personal projects I think um it's up to each of us to figure out what's the difference we want to make in the world With landing AI you help already established companies grow their AI and machine learning efforts how does a large company integrate machine learning into their efforts? AI is a general purpose technology and I think it will transform every industry our community has already transformed to a large extent the software internet sector most software internet companies outside the top right five or six or three or four already have reasonable machine learning capabilities or or getting there it's still room for improvement but when I look outside the software internet sector everything from manufacturing agriculture, healthcare logistics transportation there's so many opportunities that very few people are working on so I think the next wave of AI is for us to also transform all of those other industries there was a McKinsey study estimating 13 trillion dollars of global economic growth US GDP is 19 trillion dollars so 13 trillion is a big number or PwC estimates 16 trillion dollars so whatever number is is large but the interesting thing to me was a lot of that impact will be outside the software internet sector so we need more teams to work with these companies to help them adopt AI and I think this is one thing so make you know help drive global economic growth and make humanity more powerful and like you said the impact is there so what are the best industries the biggest industries where AI can help perhaps outside the software tech sector frankly I think it's all of them some of the ones I'm spending a lot of time on are manufacturing agriculture look into healthcare for example in manufacturing we do a lot of work in visual inspection where today there are people standing around using the eye human eye to check if you know this plastic part or the smartphone or this thing has a scratch or a dent or something in it we can use a camera to take a picture use a algorithm deep learning and other things to check if it's defective or not and thus help factories improve yield and improve quality and improve throughput it turns out the practical problems we run into are very different than the ones you might read about in in most research papers the data sets are really small so we face small data problems you know the factories keep on changing the environment so it works well on your test set but guess what something changes in the factory the lights go on or off recently there was a factory in which a bird threw through the factory and pooped on something and so that changed stuff and so increasing our algorithm makes robustness so all the changes happen in the factory I find that we run a lot of practical problems that are not as widely discussed in academia and it's really fun kind of being on the cutting edge solving these problems before maybe before many people are even aware that there is a problem there and that's such a fascinating space you're absolutely right but what is the first step that a company should take it's just scary leap into this new world of going from the human eye inspecting to digitizing that process having a camera having an algorithm what's the first step like what's the early journey that you recommend that you see these companies taking I published a document called the AI Transformation Playbook that's online and taught briefly in the AI for Everyone course on Coursera about the long term journey that companies should take but the first step is actually to start small I've seen a lot more companies fail by starting too big than by starting too small take even Google you know most people don't realize how hard it was and how controversial it was in the early days so when I started Google Brain it was controversial you know people thought deep learning near nest tried it didn't work why would you want to do deep learning so my first internal customer within Google was the Google speech team which is not the most lucrative project in Google not the most important it's not web search or advertising but by starting small my team helped the speech team build a more accurate speech recognition system and this caused their peers other teams to start to have more faith in deep learning my second internal customer was the Google Maps team where we used computer vision to read house numbers from basic street view images to more accurately locate houses within Google Maps so improve the quality of geodata and it was only after those two successes that I then started a more serious conversation with the Google Ads team and so there's a ripple effect that you showed that it works in these cases and then it just propagates through the entire company that this thing has a lot of value and use for us I think the early small scale projects it helps the teams gain faith but also helps the teams learn what these technologies do I still remember when our first GPU server it was a server under some guy's desk and you know and then that taught us early important lessons about how do you have multiple users share a set of GPUs which is really not obvious at the time but those early lessons were important we learned a lot from that first GPU server that later helped the teams think through how to scale it up to much larger deployments Are there concrete challenges that companies face that you see is important for them to solve? I think building and deploying machine learning systems is hard there's a huge gulf between something that works in a jupyter notebook on your laptop versus something that runs their production deployment setting in a factory or agriculture plant or whatever so I see a lot of people get something to work on your laptop and say wow look what I've done and that's great that's hard that's a very important first step but a lot of teams underestimate the rest of the steps needed so for example I've heard this exact same conversation between a lot of machine learning people and business people the machine learning person says look my algorithm does well on the test set and it's a clean test set at the end of peak and the machine and the business person says thank you very much but your algorithm sucks it doesn't work and the machine learning person says no wait I did well on the test set and I think there is a gulf between what it takes to do well on the test set on your hard drive versus what it takes to work well in a deployment setting some common problems robustness and generalization you deploy something in the factory maybe they chop down a tree outside the factory so the tree no longer covers the window and the lighting is different so the test set changes and in machine learning and especially in academia we don't know how to deal with test set distributions that are dramatically different than the training set distribution you know that this research the stuff like domain annotation transfer learning you know there are people working on it but we're really not good at this so how do you actually get this to work because your test set distribution is going to change and I think also if you look at the number of lines of code in the software system the machine learning model is maybe five percent or even fewer relative to the entire software system you need to build so how do you get all that work done and make it reliable and systematic so good software engineering work is fundamental here to building a successful small machine learning system yes and the software system needs to interface with the machine learning system needs to interface with people's workloads so machine learning is automation on steroids if we take one task out of many tasks that are done in the factory so the factory does lots of things one task is vision inspection if we automate that one task it can be really valuable but you may need to redesign a lot of other tasks around that one task for example say the machine learning algorithm says this is defective what are you supposed to do do you throw it away do you get a human to double check do you want to rework it or fix it so you need to redesign a lot of tasks around that thing you've now automated so planning for the change management and making sure that the software you write is consistent with the new workflow and you take the time to explain to people what needs to happen so I think what landing AI has become good at and then I think we learned by making the steps and you know painful experiences well my what would become good at is working with our partners to think through all the things beyond just the machine learning model or running the jupyter notebook but to build the entire system manage the change process and figure out how to deploy this in a way that has an actual impact the processes that the large software tech companies use for deploying don't work for a lot of other scenarios for example when I was leading large speech teams if the speech recognition system goes down what happens well alarms goes off and then someone like me would say hey you 20 engine environment you 20 engineers please fix this but if you have a system girl in the factory there are not 20 machine learning engineers sitting around you can page your duty and have them fix it so how do you deal with the maintenance or the or the dev ops or the mo ops or the other aspects of this so these are concepts that I think landing AI and a few other teams on the cutting edge but we don't even have systematic terminology yet to describe some of the stuff we do because I think we're inventing it on the fly. So you mentioned some people are interested in discovering mathematical beauty and truth in the universe and you're interested in having a big positive impact in the world so let me ask the two are not inconsistent no they're all together I'm only half joking because you're probably interested a little bit in both but let me ask a romanticized question so much of the work your work and our discussion today has been on applied AI maybe you can even call narrow AI where the goal is to create systems that automate some specific process that adds a lot of value to the world but there's another branch of AI starting with Alan Turing that kind of dreams of creating human level or superhuman level intelligence is this something you dream of as well do you think we human beings will ever build a human level intelligence or superhuman level intelligence system? I would love to get to AGI and I think humanity will but whether it takes 100 years or 500 or 5000 I find hard to estimate do you have some folks have worries about the different trajectories that path would take even existential threats of an AGI system do you have such concerns whether in the short term or the long term? I do worry about the long term fate of humanity I do wonder as well I do worry about overpopulation on the planet Mars just not today I think there will be a day when maybe someday in the future Mars will be polluted there are all these children dying and someone will look back at this video and say Andrew how is Andrew so heartless? He didn't care about all these children dying on the planet Mars and I apologize to the future viewer I do care about the children but I just don't know how to productively work on that today your picture will be in the dictionary for the people who are ignorant about the overpopulation on Mars yes so it's a long term problem is there something in the short term we should be thinking about in terms of aligning the values of our AI systems with the values of us humans sort of something that Stuart Russell and other folks are thinking about as this system develops more and more we want to make sure that it represents the better angels of our nature the ethics the values of our society you know if you take self driving cars the biggest problem with self driving cars is not that there's some trolley dilemma and you teach this so you know how many times when you are driving your car did you face this moral dilemma who do I crash into? so I think self driving cars will run into that problem roughly as often as we do when we drive our cars the biggest problem with self driving cars is when there's a big white truck across the road and what you should do is break and not crash into it and the self driving car fails and it crashes into it so I think we need to solve that problem first I think the problem with some of these discussions about AGI you know alignments the paperclip problem is that is a huge distraction from the much harder problems that we actually need to address today it's not the hardest problems we need to address today it's not the hard problems we need to address today I think bias is a huge issue I worry about wealth and equality the AI and internet are causing an acceleration of concentration of power because we can now centralize data use AI to process it and so industry after industry we've affected every industry so the internet industry has a lot of win and take most or win and take all dynamics but we've infected all these other industries so we're also giving these other industries most of them to take all flavors so look at what Uber and Lyft did to the taxi industry so we're doing this type of thing it's a lot and so this so we're creating tremendous wealth but how do we make sure that the wealth is fairly shared I think that and then how do we help people whose jobs are displaced you know I think education is part of it there may be even more that we need to do than education I think bias is a serious issue there are adverse uses of AI like deepfakes being used for various and various purposes so I worry about some teams maybe accidentally and I hope not deliberately making a lot of noise about things that problems in the distant future rather than focusing on some of the much harder problems yeah the overshadow of the problems that we have already today they're exceptionally challenging like those you said and even the silly ones but the ones that have a huge impact huge impact which is the lighting variation outside of your factory window that that ultimately is what makes the difference between like you said the Jupiter notebook and something that actually transforms an entire industry potentially yeah and I think and then just to some companies or a regulator comes to you and says look your product is messing things up fixing it may have a revenue impact well it's much more fun to talk to them about how you promise not to wipe out humanity and to face the actually really hard problems we face so your life has been a great journey from teaching to research to entrepreneurship two questions one are there regrets moments that if you went back you would do differently and two are there moments you're especially proud of moments that made you truly happy you know I've made so many mistakes it feels like every time I discover something I go why didn't I think of this you know five years earlier or even 10 years earlier and as recently and then sometimes I read a book and I go I wish I read this book 10 years ago my life would have been so different although that happened recently and then I was thinking if only I read this book when we're starting up Coursera I could have been so much better but I discovered the book had not yet been written we're starting Coursera so that made me feel better so that made me feel better but I find that the process of discovery we keep on finding out things that seem so obvious in hindsight but it always takes us so much longer than than I wish to to figure it out so on the second question are there moments in your life that if you look back that you're especially proud of or you're especially happy what would be the that filled you with happiness and fulfillment well two answers one does my daughter know of her yes of course because I know how much time I spent with her I just can't spend enough time with her congratulations by the way thank you and then second is helping other people I think to me I think the meaning of life is helping others achieve whatever are their dreams and then also to try to move the world forward making humanity more powerful as a whole so the times that I felt most happy most proud was when I felt someone else allowed me the good fortune of helping them a little bit on the path to their dreams I think there's no better way to end it than talking about happiness and the meaning of life so Andrew it's a huge honor me and millions of people thank you for all the work you've done thank you for talking today thank you so much thanks thanks for listening to this

significantly helped other people? if not then keep searching for something else to work on otherwise you're not living up to your full potential thank you for listening and hope to see you next time to interpret GPS signals. Looking at the FPG is completely insane. Spent about a year working on that, didn't work. So I remember Peter, great guy, him and me, sitting down in my office looking at some of the latest things we had tried that didn't work and saying, done it, what now? Because we tried so many things and it just didn't work. In the end, what we did, and Adam Coles was crucial to this, was put cameras on the ground and use cameras on the ground to localize the helicopter. And that solved the localization problem so that we could then focus on the reinforcement learning and inverse reinforcement learning techniques so it didn't actually make the helicopter fly. And I'm reminded, when I was doing this work at Stanford, around that time, there was a lot of reinforcement learning theoretical papers, but not a lot of practical applications. So the autonomous helicopter work for flying helicopters was one of the few practical applications of reinforcement learning at the time, which caused it to become pretty well known. I feel like we might have almost come full circle with today. There's so much buzz, so much hype, so much excitement about reinforcement learning. But again, we're hunting for more applications of all of these great ideas that David Kuhnke has come up with. What was the drive sort of in the face of the fact that most people are doing theoretical work? What motivates you in the uncertainty and the challenges to get the helicopter sort of to do the applied work, to get the actual system to work? Yeah, in the face of fear, uncertainty, sort of the setbacks that you mentioned for localization. I like stuff that works. In the physical world. So like, it's back to the shredder. You know, I like theory, but when I work on theory myself, and this is personal taste, I'm not saying anyone else should do what I do. But when I work on theory, I personally enjoy it more if I feel that the work I do will influence people, have positive impact, or help someone. I remember when many years ago, I was speaking with a mathematics professor, and it kind of just said, hey, why do you do what you do? It kind of just said, hey, why do you do what you do? And then he said, he had stars in his eyes when he answered. And this mathematician, not from Stanford, different university, he said, I do what I do because it helps me to discover truth and beauty in the universe. He had stars in his eyes when he said that. And I thought, that's great. I don't want to do that. I think it's great that someone does that, fully support the people that do it, a lot of respect for people that do that. But I am more motivated when I can see a line to how the work that my teams and I are doing helps people. The world needs all sorts of people. I'm just one type. I don't think everyone should do things the same way as I do. But when I delve into either theory or practice, if I personally have conviction that here's a pathway to help people, I find that more satisfying to have that conviction. That's your path. You were a proponent of deep learning before it gained widespread acceptance. What did you see in this field that gave you confidence? What was your thinking process like in that first decade of the, I don't know what that's called, 2000s, the aughts? Yeah, I can tell you the thing we got wrong and the thing we got right. The thing we really got wrong was the importance of, the early importance of unsupervised learning. So early days of Google Brain, we put a lot of effort into unsupervised learning rather than supervised learning. And there was this argument, I think it was around 2005 after NeurIPS, at that time called NIPS, but now NeurIPS had ended. And Jeff Hinton and I were sitting in the cafeteria outside the conference. We had lunch, we were just chatting. And Jeff pulled up this napkin. He started sketching this argument on a napkin. It was very compelling, as I'll repeat it. Human brain has about a hundred trillion. So there's 10 to the 14 synaptic connections. You will live for about 10 to the nine seconds. That's 30 years. You actually live for two by 10 to the nine, maybe three by 10 to the nine seconds. So just let's say 10 to the nine. So if each synaptic connection, each weight in your brain's neural network has just a one bit parameter, that's 10 to the 14 bits you need to learn in up to 10 to the nine seconds. 10 to the nine seconds of your life. So via this simple argument, which is a lot of problems, it's very simplified. That's 10 to the five bits per second you need to learn in your life. And I have a one year old daughter. I am not pointing out 10 to five bits per second of labels to her. And I think I'm a very loving parent, but I'm just not gonna do that. So from this very crude, definitely problematic argument, there's just no way that most of what we know is through supervised learning. But where you get so many bits of information is from sucking in images, audio, those experiences in the world. And so that argument, and there are a lot of known forces argument you should go into, really convinced me that there's a lot of power to unsupervised learning. So that was the part that we actually maybe got wrong. I still think unsupervised learning is really important, but in the early days, 10, 15 years ago, a lot of us thought that was the path forward. Oh, so you're saying that that perhaps was the wrong intuition for the time. For the time, that was the part we got wrong. The part we got right was the importance of scale. So Adam Coates, another wonderful person, fortunate to have worked with him, he was in my group at Stanford at the time and Adam had run these experiments at Stanford showing that the bigger we train a learning algorithm, the better its performance. And it was based on that. There was a graph that Adam generated where the X axis, Y axis lines going up into the right. So the bigger you make this thing, the better its performance accuracy is the vertical axis. So it's really based on that chart that Adam generated that he gave me the conviction that you could scale these models way bigger than what we could on a few CPUs, which is where we had at Stanford that we could get even better results. And it was really based on that one figure that Adam generated that gave me the conviction to go with Sebastian Thrun to pitch starting a project at Google, which became the Google Brain project. The Brain, you go find a Google Brain. And there the intuition was scale will bring performance for the system. So we should chase a larger and larger scale. And I think people don't realize how groundbreaking of it. It's simple, but it's a groundbreaking idea that bigger data sets will result in better performance. It was controversial at the time. Some of my well meaning friends, senior people in the machine learning community, I won't name, but some of whom we know, my well meaning friends came and were trying to give me friendly, I was like, hey, Andrew, why are you doing this? This is crazy. It's in the near natural architecture. Look at these architectures of building. You just want to go for scale? Like this is a bad career move. So my well meaning friends, some of them were trying to talk me out of it. But I find that if you want to make a breakthrough, you sometimes have to have conviction and do something before it's popular, since that lets you have a bigger impact. Let me ask you just a small tangent on that topic. I find myself arguing with people saying that greater scale, especially in the context of active learning, so very carefully selecting the data set, but growing the scale of the data set is going to lead to even further breakthroughs in deep learning. And there's currently pushback at that idea that larger data sets are no longer, so you want to increase the efficiency of learning. You want to make better learning mechanisms. And I personally believe that bigger data sets will still, with the same learning methods we have now, will result in better performance. What's your intuition at this time on this dual side? Do we need to come up with better architectures for learning or can we just get bigger, better data sets that will improve performance? I think both are important and it's also problem dependent. So for a few data sets, we may be approaching a Bayes error rate or approaching or surpassing human level performance and then there's that theoretical ceiling that we will never surpass, so Bayes error rate. But then I think there are plenty of problems where we're still quite far from either human level performance or from Bayes error rate and bigger data sets with neural networks without further algorithmic innovation will be sufficient to take us further. But on the flip side, if we look at the recent breakthroughs using transforming networks or language models, it was a combination of novel architecture but also scale had a lot to do with it. If we look at what happened with GP2 and BERTZ, I think scale was a large part of the story. Yeah, that's not often talked about is the scale of the data set it was trained on and the quality of the data set because there's some, so it was like reddit threads that had, they were operated highly. So there's already some weak supervision on a very large data set that people don't often talk about, right? I find that today we have maturing processes to managing code, things like Git, right? Version control. It took us a long time to evolve the good processes. I remember when my friends and I were emailing each other C++ files in email, but then we had, was it CVS or version Git? Maybe something else in the future. We're very mature in terms of tools for managing data and think about the clean data and how to solve down very hot, messy data problems. I think there's a lot of innovation there to be had still. I love the idea that you were versioning through email. I'll give you one example. When we work with manufacturing companies, it's not at all uncommon for there to be multiple labels that disagree with each other, right? And so we would do the work in visual inspection. We will take, say, a plastic part and show it to one inspector and the inspector, sometimes very opinionated, they'll go, clearly, that's a defect. This scratch, unacceptable. Gotta reject this part. Take the same part to different inspector, different, very opinionated. Clearly, the scratch is small. It's fine. Don't throw it away. You're gonna make us, you know. And then sometimes you take the same plastic part, show it to the same inspector in the afternoon, I suppose, in the morning, and very opinionated go, in the morning, they say, clearly, it's okay. In the afternoon, equally confident. Clearly, this is a defect. And so what is an AI team supposed to do if sometimes even one person doesn't agree with himself or herself in the span of a day? So I think these are the types of very practical, very messy data problems that my teams wrestle with. In the case of large consumer internet companies where you have a billion users, you have a lot of data. You don't worry about it. Just take the average. It kind of works. But in a case of other industry settings, we don't have big data. If just a small data, very small data sets, maybe around 100 defective parts or 100 examples of a defect. If you have only 100 examples, these little labeling errors, if 10 of your 100 labels are wrong, that actually is 10% of your data set has a big impact. So how do you clean this up? What are you supposed to do? This is an example of the types of things that my teams, this is a landing AI example, are wrestling with to deal with small data, which comes up all the time once you're outside consumer internet. Yeah, that's fascinating. So then you invest more effort and time in thinking about the actual labeling process. What are the labels? What are the how are disagreements resolved and all those kinds of like pragmatic real world problems. That's a fascinating space. Yeah, I find that actually when I'm teaching at Stanford, I increasingly encourage students at Stanford to try to find their own project for the end of term project, rather than just downloading someone else's nicely clean data set. It's actually much harder if you need to go and define your own problem and find your own data set, rather than you go to one of the several good websites, very good websites with clean scoped data sets that you could just work on. You're now running three efforts, the AI Fund, Landing AI, and deeplearning.ai. As you've said, the AI Fund is involved in creating new companies from scratch. Landing AI is involved in helping already established companies do AI and deeplearning.ai is for education of everyone else or of individuals interested in getting into the field and excelling in it. So let's perhaps talk about each of these areas. First, deeplearning.ai. How, the basic question, how does a person interested in deep learning get started in the field? Deep learning.ai is working to create courses to help people break into AI. So my machine learning course that I taught through Stanford is one of the most popular courses on Coursera. To this day, it's probably one of the courses, sort of, if I asked somebody, how did you get into machine learning or how did you fall in love with machine learning or would get you interested, it always goes back to Andrew Ng at some point. I see, yeah, I'm sure. You've influenced, the amount of people you've influenced is ridiculous. So for that, I'm sure I speak for a lot of people say big thank you. No, yeah, thank you. I was once reading a news article, I think it was tech review and I'm gonna mess up the statistic, but I remember reading an article that said something like one third of all programmers are self taught. I may have the number one third, around me was two thirds, but when I read that article, I thought this doesn't make sense. Everyone is self taught. So, cause you teach yourself. I don't teach people. That's well put. Yeah, so how does one get started in deep learning and where does deeplearning.ai fit into that? So the deep learning specialization offered by deeplearning.ai is I think it was Coursera's top specialization. It might still be. So it's a very popular way for people to take that specialization to learn about everything from neural networks to how to tune in your network to what is a ConvNet to what is a RNN or a sequence model or what is an attention model. And so the deep learning specialization steps everyone through those algorithms so you deeply understand it and can implement it and use it for whatever application. From the very beginning. So what would you say are the prerequisites for somebody to take the deep learning specialization in terms of maybe math or programming background? Yeah, need to understand basic programming since there are programming exercises in Python and the math prereq is quite basic. So no calculus is needed. If you know calculus is great, you get better intuitions but deliberately try to teach that specialization without requiring calculus. So I think high school math would be sufficient. If you know how to multiply two matrices, I think that's great. So a little basic linear algebra is great. Basic linear algebra, even very, very basic linear algebra in some programming. I think that people that have done the machine learning course will find a deep learning specialization a bit easier but it's also possible to jump into the deep learning specialization directly but it will be a little bit harder since we tend to go over faster concepts like how does gradient descent work and what is the objective function which is covered more slowly in the machine learning course. Could you briefly mention some of the key concepts in deep learning that students should learn that you envision them learning in the first few months in the first year or so? So if you take the deep learning specialization, you learn the foundations of what is a neural network. How do you build up a neural network from a single logistic unit to a stack of layers to different activation functions. You learn how to train the neural networks. One thing I'm very proud of in that specialization is we go through a lot of practical knowhow of how to actually make these things work. So what are the differences between different optimization algorithms? What do you do if the algorithm overfits or how do you tell if the algorithm is overfitting? When do you collect more data? When should you not bother to collect more data? I find that even today, unfortunately, there are engineers that will spend six months trying to pursue a particular direction such as collect more data because we heard more data is valuable but sometimes you could run some tests and could have figured out six months earlier that for this particular problem, collecting more data isn't going to cut it. So just don't spend six months collecting more data. Spend your time modifying the architecture or trying something else. So go through a lot of the practical knowhow so that when someone, when you take the deep learning specialization, you have those skills to be very efficient in how you build these networks. So dive right in to play with the network, to train it, to do the inference on a particular data set, to build intuition about it without building it up too big to where you spend, like you said, six months learning, building up your big project without building any intuition of a small aspect of the data that could already tell you everything you need to know about that data. Yes, and also the systematic frameworks of thinking for how to go about building practical machine learning. Maybe to make an analogy, when we learn to code, we have to learn the syntax of some programming language, right? Be it Python or C++ or Octave or whatever. But the equally important or maybe even more important part of coding is to understand how to string together these lines of code into coherent things. So when should you put something in a function column? When should you not? How do you think about abstraction? So those frameworks are what makes a programmer efficient even more than understanding the syntax. I remember when I was an undergrad at Carnegie Mellon, one of my friends would debug their code by first trying to compile it, and then it was C++ code. And then every line in the syntax error, they want to get rid of the syntax errors as quickly as possible. So how do you do that? Well, they would delete every single line of code with a syntax error. So really efficient for getting rid of syntax errors for horrible debugging errors. So I think we learn how to debug. And I think in machine learning, the way you debug a machine learning program is very different than the way you do binary search or whatever, or use a debugger, trace through the code in traditional software engineering. So it's an evolving discipline, but I find that the people that are really good at debugging machine learning algorithms are easily 10x, maybe 100x faster at getting something to work. And the basic process of debugging is, so the bug in this case, why isn't this thing learning, improving, sort of going into the questions of overfitting and all those kinds of things? That's the logical space that the debugging is happening in with neural networks. Yeah, often the question is, why doesn't it work yet? Or can I expect it to eventually work? And what are the things I could try? Change the architecture, more data, more regularization, different optimization algorithm, different types of data. So to answer those questions systematically, so that you don't spend six months hitting down the blind alley before someone comes and says, why did you spend six months doing this? What concepts in deep learning do you think students struggle the most with? Or sort of is the biggest challenge for them was to get over that hill. It hooks them and it inspires them and they really get it. Similar to learning mathematics, I think one of the challenges of deep learning is that there are a lot of concepts that build on top of each other. If you ask me what's hard about mathematics, I have a hard time pinpointing one thing. Is it addition, subtraction? Is it a carry? Is it multiplication? There's just a lot of stuff. I think one of the challenges of learning math and of learning certain technical fields is that there are a lot of concepts and if you miss a concept, then you're kind of missing the prerequisite for something that comes later. So in the deep learning specialization, try to break down the concepts to maximize the odds of each component being understandable. So when you move on to the more advanced thing, we learn confidence, hopefully you have enough intuitions from the earlier sections to then understand why we structure confidence in a certain way and then eventually why we built RNNs and LSTMs or attention models in a certain way building on top of the earlier concepts. Actually, I'm curious, you do a lot of teaching as well. Do you have a favorite, this is the hard concept moment in your teaching? Well, I don't think anyone's ever turned the interview on me. I'm glad you get first. I think that's a really good question. Yeah, it's really hard to capture the moment when they struggle. I think you put it really eloquently. I do think there's moments that are like aha moments that really inspire people. I think for some reason, reinforcement learning, especially deep reinforcement learning is a really great way to really inspire people and get what the use of neural networks can do. Even though neural networks really are just a part of the deep RL framework, but it's a really nice way to paint the entirety of the picture of a neural network being able to learn from scratch, knowing nothing and explore the world and pick up lessons. I find that a lot of the aha moments happen when you use deep RL to teach people about neural networks, which is counterintuitive. I find like a lot of the inspired sort of fire in people's passion, people's eyes, it comes from the RL world. Do you find reinforcement learning to be a useful part of the teaching process or no? I still teach reinforcement learning in one of my Stanford classes and my PhD thesis was on reinforcement learning. So I clearly loved a few. I find that if I'm trying to teach students the most useful techniques for them to use today, I end up shrinking the amount of time I talk about reinforcement learning. It's not what's working today. Now, our world changes so fast. Maybe this will be totally different in a couple of years. But I think we need a couple more things for reinforcement learning to get there. One of my teams is looking to reinforcement learning for some robotic control tasks. So I see the applications, but if you look at it as a percentage of all of the impact of the types of things we do, it's at least today outside of playing video games, right? In a few of the games, the scope. Actually, at NeurIPS, a bunch of us were standing around saying, hey, what's your best example of an actual deploy reinforcement learning application? And among like senior machine learning researchers, right? And again, there are some emerging ones, but there are not that many great examples. I think you're absolutely right. The sad thing is there hasn't been a big impactful real world application of reinforcement learning. I think its biggest impact to me has been in the toy domain, in the game domain, in the small example. That's what I mean for educational purpose. It seems to be a fun thing to explore in your networks with. But I think from your perspective, and I think that might be the best perspective is if you're trying to educate with a simple example in order to illustrate how this can actually be grown to scale and have a real world impact, then perhaps focusing on the fundamentals of supervised learning in the context of a simple data set, even like an MNIST data set is the right way, is the right path to take. The amount of fun I've seen people have with reinforcement learning has been great, but not in the applied impact in the real world setting. So it's a trade off, how much impact you want to have versus how much fun you want to have. Yeah, that's really cool. And I feel like the world actually needs all sorts. Even within machine learning, I feel like deep learning is so exciting, but the AI team shouldn't just use deep learning. I find that my teams use a portfolio of tools. And maybe that's not the exciting thing to say, but some days we use a neural net, some days we use a PCA. Actually, the other day, I was sitting down with my team looking at PCA residuals, trying to figure out what's going on with PCA applied to manufacturing problem. And some days we use a probabilistic graphical model, some days we use a knowledge draft, which is one of the things that has tremendous industry impact. But the amount of chatter about knowledge drafts in academia is really thin compared to the actual real world impact. So I think reinforcement learning should be in that portfolio. And then it's about balancing how much we teach all of these things. And the world should have diverse skills. It'd be sad if everyone just learned one narrow thing. Yeah, the diverse skill help you discover the right tool for the job. What is the most beautiful, surprising or inspiring idea in deep learning to you? Something that captivated your imagination. Is it the scale that could be, the performance that could be achieved with scale? Or is there other ideas? I think that if my only job was being an academic researcher, if an unlimited budget and didn't have to worry about short term impact and only focus on long term impact, I'd probably spend all my time doing research on unsupervised learning. I still think unsupervised learning is a beautiful idea. At both this past NeurIPS and ICML, I was attending workshops or listening to various talks about self supervised learning, which is one vertical segment maybe of unsupervised learning that I'm excited about. Maybe just to summarize the idea, I guess you know the idea about describing fleet. No, please. So here's the example of self supervised learning. Let's say we grab a lot of unlabeled images off the internet. So with infinite amounts of this type of data, I'm going to take each image and rotate it by a random multiple of 90 degrees. And then I'm going to train a supervised neural network to predict what was the original orientation. So it has to be rotated 90 degrees, 180 degrees, 270 degrees, or zero degrees. So you can generate an infinite amounts of labeled data because you rotated the image so you know what's the ground truth label. And so various researchers have found that by taking unlabeled data and making up labeled data sets and training a large neural network on these tasks, you can then take the hidden layer representation and transfer it to a different task very powerfully. Learning word embeddings where we take a sentence, delete a word, predict the missing word, which is how we learn. One of the ways we learn word embeddings is another example. And I think there's now this portfolio of techniques for generating these made up tasks. Another one called jigsaw would be if you take an image, cut it up into a three by three grid, so like a nine, three by three puzzle piece, jump up the nine pieces and have a neural network predict which of the nine factorial possible permutations it came from. So many groups, including OpenAI, Peter B has been doing some work on this too, Facebook, Google Brain, I think DeepMind, oh actually, Aaron van der Oort has great work on the CPC objective. So many teams are doing exciting work and I think this is a way to generate infinite label data and I find this a very exciting piece of unsupervised learning. So long term you think that's going to unlock a lot of power in machine learning systems is this kind of unsupervised learning. I don't think there's a whole enchilada, I think it's just a piece of it and I think this one piece unsupervised, self supervised learning is starting to get traction. We're very close to it being useful. Well, word embedding is really useful. I think we're getting closer and closer to just having a significant real world impact maybe in computer vision and video but I think this concept and I think there'll be other concepts around it. You know, other unsupervised learning things that I worked on I've been excited about. I was really excited about sparse coding and ICA, slow feature analysis. I think all of these are ideas that various of us were working on about a decade ago before we all got distracted by how well supervised learning was doing. So we would return we would return to the fundamentals of representation learning that really started this movement of deep learning. I think there's a lot more work that one could explore around this theme of ideas and other ideas to come up with better algorithms. So if we could return to maybe talk quickly about the specifics of deep learning.ai the deep learning specialization perhaps how long does it take to complete the course would you say? The official length of the deep learning specialization is I think 16 weeks so about four months but it's go at your own pace. So if you subscribe to the deep learning specialization there are people that finished it in less than a month by working more intensely and studying more intensely so it really depends on on the individual. When we created the deep learning specialization we wanted to make it very accessible and very affordable. And with you know Coursera and deep learning.ai education mission one of the things that's really important to me is that if there's someone for whom paying anything is a financial hardship then just apply for financial aid and get it for free. If you were to recommend a daily schedule for people in learning whether it's through the deep learning.ai specialization or just learning in the world of deep learning what would you recommend? How do they go about day to day sort of specific advice about learning about their journey in the world of deep learning machine learning? I think getting the habit of learning is key and that means regularity. So for example we send out a weekly newsletter the batch every Wednesday so people know it's coming Wednesday you can spend a little bit of time on Wednesday catching up on the latest news catching up on the latest news through the batch on Wednesday and for myself I've picked up a habit of spending some time every Saturday and every Sunday reading or studying and so I don't wake up on the Saturday and have to make a decision do I feel like reading or studying today or not it's just what I do and the fact is a habit makes it easier. So I think if someone can get into that habit it's like you know just like we brush our teeth every morning I don't think about it if I thought about it it's a little bit annoying to have to spend two minutes doing that but it's a habit that it takes no cognitive load but this would be so much harder if we have to make a decision every morning and actually that's the reason why I wear the same thing every day as well it's just one less decision I just get up and wear my blue shirt so but I think if you can get that habit that consistency of studying then it actually feels easier. So yeah it's kind of amazing in my own life like I play guitar every day for I force myself to at least for five minutes play guitar it's just it's a ridiculously short period of time but because I've gotten into that habit it's incredible what you can accomplish in a period of a year or two years you can become you know exceptionally good at certain aspects of a thing by just doing it every day for a very short period of time it's kind of a miracle that that's how it works it adds up over time. Yeah and I think this is often not about the bursts of sustained efforts and the all nighters because you could only do that a limited number of times it's the sustained effort over a long time I think you know reading two research papers is a nice thing to do but the power is not reading two research papers it's reading two research papers a week for a year then you read a hundred papers and you actually learn a lot when you read a hundred papers. So regularity and making learning a habit do you have general other study tips for particularly deep learning that people should in their process of learning is there some kind of recommendations or tips you have as they learn? One thing I still do when I'm trying to study something really deeply is take handwritten notes it varies I know there are a lot of people that take the deep learning courses during a commute or something where it may be more awkward to take notes so I know it may not work for everyone but when I'm taking courses on Coursera and I still take some every now and then the most recent one I took was a course on clinical trials because I was interested about that I got out my little Moleskine notebook and what I was seeing on my desk was just taking down notes so what the instructor was saying and that act we know that that act of taking notes preferably handwritten notes increases retention. So as you're sort of watching the video just kind of pausing maybe and then taking the basic insights down on paper. Yeah so there have been a few studies if you search online you find some of these studies that taking handwritten notes because handwriting is slower as we're saying just now it causes you to recode the knowledge in your own words more and that process of recoding promotes long term retention this is as opposed to typing which is fine again typing is better than nothing or in taking a class and not taking notes is better than not taking any class at all but comparing handwritten notes and typing you can usually type faster for a lot of people you can handwrite notes and so when people type they're more likely to just transcribe verbatim what they heard and that reduces the amount of recoding and that actually results in less long term retention. I don't know what the psychological effect there is but so true there's something fundamentally different about writing hand handwriting I wonder what that is I wonder if it is as simple as just the time it takes to write it slower yeah and because you can't write as many words you have to take whatever they said and summarize it into fewer words and that summarization process requires deeper processing of the meaning which then results in better retention that's fascinating oh and I think because of Coursera I spent so much time studying pedagogy this is actually one of my passions I really love learning how to more efficiently help others learn you know one of the things I do both when creating videos or when we write the batch is I try to think is one minute spent of us going to be a more efficient learning experience than one minute spent anywhere else and we really try to you know make it time efficient for the learners because you know everyone's busy so when when we're editing I often tell my teams every word needs to fight for its life and if you can delete a word let's just delete it and not wait let's not waste the learning time let's not waste the learning time oh that's so it's so amazing that you think that way because there is millions of people that are impacted by your teaching and sort of that one minute spent has a ripple effect right through years of time which is it's just fascinating to think about how does one make a career out of an interest in deep learning do you have advice for people we just talked about sort of the beginning early steps but if you want to make it an entire life's journey or at least a journey of a decade or two how do you how do you do it so most important thing is to get started right and and I think in the early parts of a career coursework um like the deep learning specialization or it's a very efficient way to master this material so because you know instructors uh be it me or someone else or you know Lawrence Maroney teaches our TensorFlow specialization or other things we're working on spend effort to try to make it time efficient for you to learn a new concept so coursework is actually a very efficient way for people to learn concepts and the beginning parts of breaking into a new field in fact one thing I see at Stanford some of my PhD students want to jump in the research right away and I actually tend to say look in your first couple years of PhD and spend time taking courses because it lays a foundation it's fine if you're less productive in your first couple years you'll be better off in the long term beyond a certain point there's materials that doesn't exist in courses because it's too cutting edge the course hasn't been created yet there's some practical experience that we're not yet that good as teaching in a course and I think after exhausting the efficient coursework then most people need to go on to either ideally work on projects and then maybe also continue their learning by reading blog posts and research papers and things like that doing projects is really important and again I think it's important to start small and just do something today you read about deep learning feels like oh all these people doing such exciting things what if I'm not building a neural network that changes the world then what's the point? Well the point is sometimes building that tiny neural network you know be it MNIST or upgrade to a fashion MNIST to whatever so doing your own fun hobby project that's how you gain the skills to let you do bigger and bigger projects I find this to be true at the individual level and also at the organizational level for a company to become good at machine learning sometimes the right thing to do is not to tackle the giant project is instead to do the small project that lets the organization learn and then build out from there but this is true both for individuals and for companies taking the first step and then taking small steps is the key should students pursue a PhD do you think you can do so much that's one of the fascinating things in machine learning you can have so much impact without ever getting a PhD so what are your thoughts should people go to grad school should people get a PhD? I think that there are multiple good options of which doing a PhD could be one of them I think that if someone's admitted to a top PhD program you know at MIT, Stanford, top schools I think that's a very good experience or if someone gets a job at a top organization at the top AI team I think that's also a very good experience there are some things you still need a PhD to do if someone's aspiration is to be a professor you know at the top academic university you just need a PhD to do that but if it goes to you know start a company, build a company do great technical work I think a PhD is a good experience but I would look at the different options available to someone you know where are the places where you can get a job where are the places to get a PhD program and kind of weigh the pros and cons of those So just to linger on that for a little bit longer what final dreams and goals do you think people should have so what options should they explore so you can work in industry so for a large company\n",

      "Text: The following is a conversation with Yann LeCun. He's considered to be one of the fathers of deep learning, which, if you've been hiding under a rock, is the recent revolution in AI that has captivated the world with the possibility of what machines can learn from data. He's a professor at New York University, a vice president and chief AI scientist at Facebook, and co recipient of the Turing Award for his work on deep learning. He's probably best known as the founding father of convolutional neural networks, in particular their application to optical character recognition and the famed MNIST dataset. He is also an outspoken personality, unafraid to speak his mind in a distinctive French accent and explore provocative ideas, both in the rigorous medium of academic research and the somewhat less rigorous medium of Twitter and Facebook. This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast. If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube, give it five stars on iTunes, support it on Patreon, or simply connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N. And now, here's my conversation with Yann LeCun. You said that 2001 Space Odyssey is one of your favorite movies. Hal 9000 decides to get rid of the astronauts for people who haven't seen the movie, spoiler alert, because he, it, she believes that the astronauts, they will interfere with the mission. Do you see Hal as flawed in some fundamental way or even evil, or did he do the right thing? Neither. There's no notion of evil in that context, other than the fact that people die, but it was an example of what people call value misalignment, right? You give an objective to a machine, and the machine strives to achieve this objective. And if you don't put any constraints on this objective, like don't kill people and don't do things like this, the machine, given the power, will do stupid things just to achieve this objective, or damaging things to achieve this objective. It's a little bit like, I mean, we're used to this in the context of human society. We put in place laws to prevent people from doing bad things, because spontaneously, they would do those bad things, right? So we have to shape their cost function, their objective function, if you want, through laws to kind of correct, and education, obviously, to sort of correct for those. So maybe just pushing a little further on that point, how, you know, there's a mission, there's this fuzziness around, the ambiguity around what the actual mission is, but, you know, do you think that there will be a time, from a utilitarian perspective, where an AI system, where it is not misalignment, where it is alignment, for the greater good of society, that an AI system will make decisions that are difficult? Well, that's the trick. I mean, eventually we'll have to figure out how to do this. And again, we're not starting from scratch, because we've been doing this with humans for millennia. So designing objective functions for people is something that we know how to do. And we don't do it by, you know, programming things, although the legal code is called code. So that tells you something. And it's actually the design of an objective function. That's really what legal code is, right? It tells you, here is what you can do, here is what you can't do. If you do it, you pay that much, that's an objective function. So there is this idea somehow that it's a new thing for people to try to design objective functions that are aligned with the common good. But no, we've been writing laws for millennia and that's exactly what it is. So that's where, you know, the science of lawmaking and computer science will. Come together. Will come together. So there's nothing special about HAL or AI systems, it's just the continuation of tools used to make some of these difficult ethical judgments that laws make. Yeah, and we have systems like this already that make many decisions for ourselves in society that need to be designed in a way that they, like rules about things that sometimes have bad side effects and we have to be flexible enough about those rules so that they can be broken when it's obvious that they shouldn't be applied. So you don't see this on the camera here, but all the decoration in this room is all pictures from 2001 and Space Odyssey. Wow, is that by accident or is there a lot? No, by accident, it's by design. Oh, wow. So if you were to build HAL 10,000, so an improvement of HAL 9,000, what would you improve? Well, first of all, I wouldn't ask it to hold secrets and tell lies because that's really what breaks it in the end, that's the fact that it's asking itself questions about the purpose of the mission and it's, you know, pieces things together that it's heard, you know, all the secrecy of the preparation of the mission and the fact that it was the discovery on the lunar surface that really was kept secret and one part of HAL's memory knows this and the other part does not know it and is supposed to not tell anyone and that creates internal conflict. So you think there's never should be a set of things that an AI system should not be allowed, like a set of facts that should not be shared with the human operators? Well, I think, no, I think it should be a bit like in the design of autonomous AI systems, there should be the equivalent of, you know, the oath that a hypocrite oath that doctors sign up to, right? So there's certain things, certain rules that you have to abide by and we can sort of hardwire this into our machines to kind of make sure they don't go. So I'm not, you know, an advocate of the three laws of robotics, you know, the Asimov kind of thing because I don't think it's practical, but, you know, some level of limits. But to be clear, these are not questions that are kind of really worth asking today because we just don't have the technology to do this. We don't have autonomous intelligent machines, we have intelligent machines. Some are intelligent machines that are very specialized, but they don't really sort of satisfy an objective. They're just, you know, kind of trained to do one thing. So until we have some idea for design of a full fledged autonomous intelligent system, asking the question of how we design this objective, I think is a little too abstract. It's a little too abstract. There's useful elements to it in that it helps us understand our own ethical codes, humans. So even just as a thought experiment, if you imagine that an AGI system is here today, how would we program it is a kind of nice thought experiment of constructing how should we have a law, have a system of laws for us humans. It's just a nice practical tool. And I think there's echoes of that idea too in the AI systems we have today that don't have to be that intelligent. Yeah. Like autonomous vehicles. These things start creeping in that are worth thinking about, but certainly they shouldn't be framed as how. Yeah. Looking back, what is the most, I'm sorry if it's a silly question, but what is the most beautiful or surprising idea in deep learning or AI in general that you've ever come across? Sort of personally, when you said back and just had this kind of, oh, that's pretty cool moment. That's nice. That's surprising. I don't know if it's an idea rather than a sort of empirical fact. The fact that you can build gigantic neural nets, train them on relatively small amounts of data relatively with stochastic gradient descent and that it actually works, breaks everything you read in every textbook, right? Every pre deep learning textbook that told you, you need to have fewer parameters and you have data samples. If you have a non convex objective function, you have no guarantee of convergence. All those things that you read in textbook and they tell you to stay away from this and they're all wrong. The huge number of parameters, non convex, and somehow which is very relative to the number of parameters data, it's able to learn anything. Right. Does that still surprise you today? Well, it was kind of obvious to me before I knew anything that this is a good idea. And then it became surprising that it worked because I started reading those textbooks. Okay. Okay. So can you talk through the intuition of why it was obvious to you if you remember? Well, okay. So the intuition was it's sort of like, those people in the late 19th century who proved that heavier than air flight was impossible. And of course you have birds, right? They do fly. And so on the face of it, it's obviously wrong as an empirical question, right? And so we have the same kind of thing that we know that the brain works. We don't know how, but we know it works. And we know it's a large network of neurons and interaction and that learning takes place by changing the connection. So kind of getting this level of inspiration without copying the details, but sort of trying to derive basic principles, and that kind of gives you a clue as to which direction to go. There's also the idea somehow that I've been convinced of since I was an undergrad that, even before, that intelligence is inseparable from learning. So the idea somehow that you can create an intelligent machine by basically programming, for me it was a non starter from the start. Every intelligent entity that we know about arrives at this intelligence through learning. So machine learning was a completely obvious path. Also because I'm lazy, so, you know, kind of. He's automate basically everything and learning is the automation of intelligence. So do you think, so what is learning then? What falls under learning? Because do you think of reasoning as learning? Well, reasoning is certainly a consequence of learning as well, just like other functions of the brain. The big question about reasoning is, how do you make reasoning compatible with gradient based learning? Do you think neural networks can be made to reason? Yes, there is no question about that. Again, we have a good example, right? The question is how? So the question is how much prior structure do you have to put in the neural net so that something like human reasoning will emerge from it, you know, from learning? Another question is all of our kind of model of what reasoning is that are based on logic are discrete and are therefore incompatible with gradient based learning. And I'm a very strong believer in this idea of gradient based learning. I don't believe that other types of learning that don't use kind of gradient information if you want. So you don't like discrete mathematics? You don't like anything discrete? Well, that's, it's not that I don't like it, it's just that it's incompatible with learning and I'm a big fan of learning, right? So in fact, that's perhaps one reason why deep learning has been kind of looked at with suspicion by a lot of computer scientists because the math is very different. The math that you use for deep learning, you know, it kind of has more to do with, you know, cybernetics, the kind of math you do in electrical engineering than the kind of math you do in computer science. And, you know, nothing in machine learning is exact, right? Computer science is all about sort of, you know, obviously compulsive attention to details of like, you know, every index has to be right. And you can prove that an algorithm is correct, right? Machine learning is the science of sloppiness, really. That's beautiful. So, okay, maybe let's feel around in the dark of what is a neural network that reasons or a system that works with continuous functions that's able to do, build knowledge, however we think about reasoning, build on previous knowledge, build on extra knowledge, create new knowledge, generalize outside of any training set to ever build. What does that look like? If, yeah, maybe give inklings of thoughts of what that might look like. Yeah, I mean, yes and no. If I had precise ideas about this, I think, you know, we'd be building it right now. And there are people working on this whose main research interest is actually exactly that, right? So what you need to have is a working memory. So you need to have some device, if you want, some subsystem that can store a relatively large number of factual episodic information for, you know, a reasonable amount of time. So, you know, in the brain, for example, there are kind of three main types of memory. One is the sort of memory of the state of your cortex. And that sort of disappears within 20 seconds. You can't remember things for more than about 20 seconds or a minute if you don't have any other form of memory. The second type of memory, which is longer term, is still short term, is the hippocampus. So you can, you know, you came into this building, you remember where the exit is, where the elevators are. You have some map of that building that's stored in your hippocampus. You might remember something about what I said, you know, a few minutes ago. I forgot it all already. Of course, it's been erased, but, you know, but that would be in your hippocampus. And then the longer term memory is in the synapse, the synapses, right? So what you need if you want a system that's capable of reasoning is that you want the hippocampus like thing, right? And that's what people have tried to do with memory networks and, you know, neural training machines and stuff like that, right? And now with transformers, which have sort of a memory in there, kind of self attention system. You can think of it this way. So that's one element you need. Another thing you need is some sort of network that can access this memory, get an information back and then kind of crunch on it and then do this iteratively multiple times because a chain of reasoning is a process by which you update your knowledge about the state of the world, about, you know, what's going to happen, et cetera. And that has to be this sort of recurrent operation basically. And you think that kind of, if we think about a transformer, so that seems to be too small to contain the knowledge that's, to represent the knowledge that's contained in Wikipedia, for example. Well, a transformer doesn't have this idea of recurrence. It's got a fixed number of layers and that's the number of steps that, you know, limits basically its representation. But recurrence would build on the knowledge somehow. I mean, it would evolve the knowledge and expand the amount of information perhaps or useful information within that knowledge. But is this something that just can emerge with size? Because it seems like everything we have now is too small. Not just, no, it's not clear. I mean, how you access and write into an associative memory in an efficient way. I mean, sort of the original memory network maybe had something like the right architecture, but if you try to scale up a memory network so that the memory contains all the Wikipedia, it doesn't quite work. Right. So there's a need for new ideas there, okay. But it's not the only form of reasoning. So there's another form of reasoning, which is true, which is very classical also in some types of AI. And it's based on, let's call it energy minimization. Okay, so you have some sort of objective, some energy function that represents the quality or the negative quality, okay. Energy goes up when things get bad and they get low when things get good. So let's say you want to figure out, what gestures do I need to do to grab an object or walk out the door. If you have a good model of your own body, a good model of the environment, using this kind of energy minimization, you can do planning. And in optimal control, it's called model predictive control. You have a model of what's gonna happen in the world as a consequence of your actions. And that allows you to, by energy minimization, figure out the sequence of action that optimizes a particular objective function, which measures, minimizes the number of times you're gonna hit something and the energy you're gonna spend doing the gesture and et cetera. So that's a form of reasoning. Planning is a form of reasoning. And perhaps what led to the ability of humans to reason is the fact that, or species that appear before us had to do some sort of planning to be able to hunt and survive and survive the winter in particular. And so it's the same capacity that you need to have. So in your intuition is, if we look at expert systems and encoding knowledge as logic systems, as graphs, in this kind of way, is not a useful way to think about knowledge? Graphs are a little brittle or logic representation. So basically, variables that have values and then constraint between them that are represented by rules, is a little too rigid and too brittle, right? So some of the early efforts in that respect were to put probabilities on them. So a rule, if you have this and that symptom, you have this disease with that probability and you should prescribe that antibiotic with that probability, right? That's the mycin system from the 70s. And that's what that branch of AI led to, based on networks and graphical models and causal inference and variational method. So there is certainly a lot of interesting work going on in this area. The main issue with this is knowledge acquisition. How do you reduce a bunch of data to a graph of this type? Yeah, it relies on the expert, on the human being, to encode, to add knowledge. And that's essentially impractical. Yeah, it's not scalable. That's a big question. The second question is, do you want to represent knowledge as symbols and do you want to manipulate them with logic? And again, that's incompatible with learning. So one suggestion, which Jeff Hinton has been advocating for many decades, is replace symbols by vectors. Think of it as pattern of activities in a bunch of neurons or units or whatever you want to call them. And replace logic by continuous functions. Okay, and that becomes now compatible. but most of those are incredibly boring. What I like is select, you know, 10% of them that are kind of the most informative. And with just that, I would probably reach the same. So it's a weak form of active learning if you want. Yes, but there might be a much stronger version. Yeah, that's right. That's what, and that's an awful question if it exists. The question is how much stronger can you get? Elon Musk is confident. Talked to him recently. He's confident that large scale data and deep learning can solve the autonomous driving problem. What are your thoughts on the limits, possibilities of deep learning in this space? It's obviously part of the solution. I mean, I don't think we'll ever have a set driving system or at least not in the foreseeable future that does not use deep learning. Let me put it this way. Now, how much of it? So in the history of sort of engineering, particularly sort of AI like systems, there's generally a first phase where everything is built by hand. Then there is a second phase. And that was the case for autonomous driving 20, 30 years ago. There's a phase where there's a little bit of learning is used, but there's a lot of engineering that's involved in kind of taking care of corner cases and putting limits, et cetera, because the learning system is not perfect. And then as technology progresses, we end up relying more and more on learning. That's the history of character recognition, it's the history of science. Character recognition is the history of speech recognition, now computer vision, natural language processing. And I think the same is going to happen with autonomous driving that currently the methods that are closest to providing some level of autonomy, some decent level of autonomy where you don't expect a driver to kind of do anything is where you constrain the world. So you only run within 100 square kilometers or square miles in Phoenix where the weather is nice and the roads are wide, which is what Waymo is doing. You completely overengineer the car with tons of LIDARs and sophisticated sensors that are too expensive for consumer cars, but they're fine if you just run a fleet. And you engineer the hell out of everything else. You map the entire world. So you have complete 3D model of everything. So the only thing that the perception system has to take care of is moving objects and construction and sort of things that weren't in your map. And you can engineer a good SLAM system and all that stuff. So that's kind of the current approach that's closest to some level of autonomy. But I think eventually the longterm solution is going to rely more and more on learning and possibly using a combination of self supervised learning and model based reinforcement or something like that. But ultimately learning will be not just at the core, but really the fundamental part of the system. Yeah, it already is, but it will become more and more. What do you think it takes to build a system with human level intelligence? You talked about the AI system in the movie Her being way out of reach, our current reach. This might be outdated as well, but. It's still way out of reach. It's still way out of reach. What would it take to build Her? Do you think? So I can tell you the first two obstacles that we have to clear, but I don't know how many obstacles there are after this. So the image I usually use is that there is a bunch of mountains that we have to climb and we can see the first one, but we don't know if there are 50 mountains behind it or not. And this might be a good sort of metaphor for why AI researchers in the past have been overly optimistic about the result of AI. You know, for example, Noel and Simon wrote the general problem solver and they called it the general problem solver. General problem solver. And of course, the first thing you realize is that all the problems you want to solve are exponential. And so you can't actually use it for anything useful, but you know. Yeah, so yeah, all you see is the first peak. So in general, what are the first couple of peaks for Her? So the first peak, which is precisely what I'm working on is self supervised learning. How do we get machines to run models of the world by observation, kind of like babies and like young animals? So we've been working with, you know, cognitive scientists. So this Emmanuelle Dupoux, who's at FAIR in Paris, is a half time, is also a researcher in a French university. And he has this chart that shows that which, how many months of life baby humans kind of learn different concepts. And you can measure this in sort of various ways. So things like distinguishing animate objects from inanimate objects, you can tell the difference at age two, three months. Whether an object is going to stay stable, is going to fall, you know, about four months, you can tell. You know, there are various things like this. And then things like gravity, the fact that objects are not supposed to float in the air, but are supposed to fall, you run this around the age of eight or nine months. If you look at the data, eight or nine months, if you look at a lot of, you know, eight month old babies, you give them a bunch of toys on their high chair. First thing they do is they throw them on the ground and they look at them. It's because, you know, they're learning about, actively learning about gravity. Gravity, yeah. Okay, so they're not trying to annoy you, but they, you know, they need to do the experiment, right? Yeah. So, you know, how do we get machines to learn like babies, mostly by observation with a little bit of interaction and learning those models of the world? Because I think that's really a crucial piece of an intelligent autonomous system. So if you think about the architecture of an intelligent autonomous system, it needs to have a predictive model of the world. So something that says, here is a world at time T, here is a state of the world at time T plus one, if I take this action. And it's not a single answer, it can be a... Yeah, it can be a distribution, yeah. Yeah, well, but we don't know how to represent distributions in high dimensional T spaces. So it's gotta be something weaker than that, okay? But with some representation of uncertainty. If you have that, then you can do what optimal control theorists call model predictive control, which means that you can run your model with a hypothesis for a sequence of action and then see the result. Now, what you need, the other thing you need is some sort of objective that you want to optimize. Am I reaching the goal of grabbing this object? Am I minimizing energy? Am I whatever, right? So there is some sort of objective that you have to minimize. And so in your head, if you have this model, you can figure out the sequence of action that will optimize your objective. That objective is something that ultimately is rooted in your basal ganglia, at least in the human brain, that's what it's basal ganglia, computes your level of contentment or miscontentment. I don't know if that's a word. Unhappiness, okay? Yeah, yeah. Discontentment. Discontentment, maybe. And so your entire behavior is driven towards kind of minimizing that objective, which is maximizing your contentment, computed by your basal ganglia. And what you have is an objective function, which is basically a predictor of what your basal ganglia is going to tell you. So you're not going to put your hand on fire because you know it's going to burn and you're going to get hurt. And you're predicting this because of your model of the world and your sort of predictor of this objective, right? So if you have those three components, you have four components, you have the hardwired objective, hardwired contentment objective computer, if you want, calculator. And then you have the three components. One is the objective predictor, which basically predicts your level of contentment. One is the model of the world. And there's a third module I didn't mention, which is the module that will figure out the best course of action to optimize an objective given your model, okay? Yeah. And you can call this a policy network or something like that, right? Now, you need those three components to act autonomously intelligently. And you can be stupid in three different ways. You can be stupid because your model of the world is wrong. You can be stupid because your objective is not aligned with what you actually want to achieve, okay? In humans, that would be a psychopath. And then the third way you can be stupid is that you have the right model, you have the right objective, but you're unable to figure out a course of action to optimize your objective given your model. Okay. Some people who are in charge of big countries actually have all three that are wrong. All right. Which countries? I don't know. Okay, so if we think about this agent, if we think about the movie Her, you've criticized the art project that is Sophia the Robot. And what that project essentially does is uses our natural inclination to anthropomorphize things that look like human and give them more. Do you think that could be used by AI systems like in the movie Her? So do you think that body is needed to create a feeling of intelligence? Well, if Sophia was just an art piece, I would have no problem with it, but it's presented as something else. Let me, on that comment real quick, if creators of Sophia could change something about their marketing or behavior in general, what would it be? What's? I'm just about everything. I mean, don't you think, here's a tough question. Let me, so I agree with you. So Sophia is not, the general public feels that Sophia can do way more than she actually can. That's right. And the people who created Sophia are not honestly publicly communicating, trying to teach the public. Right. But here's a tough question. Don't you think the same thing is scientists in industry and research are taking advantage of the same misunderstanding in the public when they create AI companies or publish stuff? Some companies, yes. I mean, there is no sense of, there's no desire to delude. There's no desire to kind of over claim when something is done, right? You publish a paper on AI that has this result on ImageNet, it's pretty clear. I mean, it's not even interesting anymore, but I don't think there is that. I mean, the reviewers are generally not very forgiving of unsupported claims of this type. And, but there are certainly quite a few startups that have had a huge amount of hype around this that I find extremely damaging and I've been calling it out when I've seen it. So yeah, but to go back to your original question, like the necessity of embodiment, I think, I don't think embodiment is necessary. I think grounding is necessary. So I don't think we're gonna get machines that really understand language without some level of grounding in the real world. And it's not clear to me that language is a high enough bandwidth medium to communicate how the real world works. So I think for this. Can you talk to what grounding means? So grounding means that, so there is this classic problem of common sense reasoning, you know, the Winograd schema, right? And so I tell you the trophy doesn't fit in the suitcase because it's too big, or the trophy doesn't fit in the suitcase because it's too small. And the it in the first case refers to the trophy in the second case to the suitcase. And the reason you can figure this out is because you know where the trophy and the suitcase are, you know, one is supposed to fit in the other one and you know the notion of size and a big object doesn't fit in a small object, unless it's a Tardis, you know, things like that, right? So you have this knowledge of how the world works, of geometry and things like that. I don't believe you can learn everything about the world by just being told in language how the world works. I think you need some low level perception of the world, you know, be it visual touch, you know, whatever, but some higher bandwidth perception of the world. By reading all the world's text, you still might not have enough information. That's right. There's a lot of things that just will never appear in text and that you can't really infer. So I think common sense will emerge from, you know, certainly a lot of language interaction, but also with watching videos or perhaps even interacting in virtual environments and possibly, you know, robot interacting in the real world. But I don't actually believe necessarily that this last one is absolutely necessary. But I think that there's a need for some grounding. But the final product doesn't necessarily need to be embodied, you're saying. No. It just needs to have an awareness, a grounding to. Right, but it needs to know how the world works to have, you know, to not be frustrating to talk to. And you talked about emotions being important. That's a whole nother topic. Well, so, you know, I talked about this, the basal ganglia as the thing that calculates your level of miscontentment. And then there is this other module that sort of tries to do a prediction of whether you're going to be content or not. That's the source of some emotion. So fear, for example, is an anticipation of bad things that can happen to you, right? You have this inkling that there is some chance that something really bad is going to happen to you and that creates fear. Well, you know for sure that something bad is going to happen to you, you kind of give up, right? It's not fear anymore. It's uncertainty that creates fear. So the punchline is, we're not going to have autonomous intelligence without emotions. Whatever the heck emotions are. So you mentioned very practical things of fear, but there's a lot of other mess around it. But there are kind of the results of, you know, drives. Yeah, there's deeper biological stuff going on. And I've talked to a few folks on this. There's fascinating stuff that ultimately connects to our brain. If we create an AGI system, sorry. Human level intelligence. Human level intelligence system. And you get to ask her one question. What would that question be? You know, I think the first one we'll create would probably not be that smart. They'd be like a four year old. Okay. So you would have to ask her a question to know she's not that smart. Yeah. Well, what's a good question to ask, you know, to be impressed. What is the cause of wind? And if she answers, oh, it's because the leaves of the tree are moving and that creates wind. She's onto something. And if she says that's a stupid question, she's really onto something. No, and then you tell her, actually, you know, here is the real thing. She says, oh yeah, that makes sense. So questions that reveal the ability to do common sense reasoning about the physical world. Yeah. And you'll sum it up with causal inference. Causal inference. Well, it was a huge honor. Congratulations on your Turing Award. Thank you so much for talking today. Thank you. Thank you for having me. There's a very good set of ideas by, written in a paper about 10 years ago by Leon Boutout, who is here at Facebook. The title of the paper is, From Machine Learning to Machine Reasoning. And his idea is that a learning system should be able to manipulate objects that are in a space and then put the result back in the same space. So it's this idea of working memory, basically. And it's very enlightening. And in a sense, that might learn something like the simple expert systems. I mean, you can learn basic logic operations there. Yeah, quite possibly. There's a big debate on sort of how much prior structure you have to put in for this kind of stuff to emerge. That's the debate I have with Gary Marcus and people like that. Yeah, yeah, so, and the other person, so I just talked to Judea Pearl, from the you mentioned causal inference world. So his worry is that the current neural networks are not able to learn what causes what causal inference between things. So I think he's right and wrong about this. If he's talking about the sort of classic type of neural nets, people sort of didn't worry too much about this. But there's a lot of people now working on causal inference. And there's a paper that just came out last week by Leon Boutou, among others, David Lopez, Baz, and a bunch of other people, exactly on that problem of how do you kind of get a neural net to sort of pay attention to real causal relationships, which may also solve issues of bias in data and things like this, so. I'd like to read that paper because that ultimately the challenges also seems to fall back on the human expert to ultimately decide causality between things. People are not very good at establishing causality, first of all. So first of all, you talk to physicists and physicists actually don't believe in causality because look at all the basic laws of microphysics are time reversible, so there's no causality. The arrow of time is not real, yeah. It's as soon as you start looking at macroscopic systems where there is unpredictable randomness, where there is clearly an arrow of time, but it's a big mystery in physics, actually, how that emerges. Is it emergent or is it part of the fundamental fabric of reality? Or is it a bias of intelligent systems that because of the second law of thermodynamics, we perceive a particular arrow of time, but in fact, it's kind of arbitrary, right? So yeah, physicists, mathematicians, they don't care about, I mean, the math doesn't care about the flow of time. Well, certainly, macrophysics doesn't. People themselves are not very good at establishing causal relationships. If you ask, I think it was in one of Seymour Papert's book on children learning. He studied with Jean Piaget. He's the guy who coauthored the book Perceptron with Marvin Minsky that kind of killed the first wave of neural nets, but he was actually a learning person. He, in the sense of studying learning in humans and machines, that's why he got interested in Perceptron. And he wrote that if you ask a little kid about what is the cause of the wind, a lot of kids will say, they will think for a while and they'll say, oh, it's the branches in the trees, they move and that creates wind, right? So they get the causal relationship backwards. And it's because their understanding of the world and intuitive physics is not that great, right? I mean, these are like, you know, four or five year old kids. You know, it gets better, and then you understand that this, it can be, right? But there are many things which we can, because of our common sense understanding of things, what people call common sense, and our understanding of physics, we can, there's a lot of stuff that we can figure out causality. Even with diseases, we can figure out what's not causing what, often. There's a lot of mystery, of course, but the idea is that you should be able to encode that into systems, because it seems unlikely they'd be able to figure that out themselves. Well, whenever we can do intervention, but you know, all of humanity has been completely deluded for millennia, probably since its existence, about a very, very wrong causal relationship, where whatever you can explain, you attribute it to, you know, some deity, some divinity, right? And that's a cop out, that's a way of saying like, I don't know the cause, so you know, God did it, right? So you mentioned Marvin Minsky, and the irony of, you know, maybe causing the first AI winter. You were there in the 90s, you were there in the 80s, of course. In the 90s, why do you think people lost faith in deep learning, in the 90s, and found it again, a decade later, over a decade later? Yeah, it wasn't called deep learning yet, it was just called neural nets, but yeah, they lost interest. I mean, I think I would put that around 1995, at least the machine learning community, there was always a neural net community, but it became kind of disconnected from sort of mainstream machine learning, if you want. There were, it was basically electrical engineering that kept at it, and computer science gave up on neural nets. I don't know, you know, I was too close to it to really sort of analyze it with sort of an unbiased eye, if you want, but I would make a few guesses. So the first one is, at the time, neural nets were, it was very hard to make them work, in the sense that you would implement backprop in your favorite language, and that favorite language was not Python, it was not MATLAB, it was not any of those things, because they didn't exist, right? You had to write it in Fortran OC, or something like this, right? So you would experiment with it, you would probably make some very basic mistakes, like, you know, badly initialize your weights, make the network too small, because you read in the textbook, you know, you don't want too many parameters, right? And of course, you know, and you would train on XOR, because you didn't have any other data set to trade on. And of course, you know, it works half the time. So you would say, I give up. Also, you would train it with batch gradient, which, you know, isn't that sufficient. So there's a lot of, there's a bag of tricks that you had to know to make those things work, or you had to reinvent, and a lot of people just didn't, and they just couldn't make it work. So that's one thing. The investment in software platform to be able to kind of, you know, display things, figure out why things don't work, kind of get a good intuition for how to get them to work, have enough flexibility so you can create, you know, network architectures like convolutional nets and stuff like that. It was hard. I mean, you had to write everything from scratch. And again, you didn't have any Python or MATLAB or anything, right? I read that, sorry to interrupt, but I read that you wrote in Lisp the first versions of Lanet with convolutional networks, which by the way, one of my favorite languages. That's how I knew you were legit. Turing award, whatever. You programmed in Lisp, that's... It's still my favorite language, but it's not that we programmed in Lisp, it's that we had to write our Lisp interpreter, okay? Because it's not like we used one that existed. So we wrote a Lisp interpreter that we hooked up to, you know, a backend library that we wrote also for sort of neural net computation. And then after a few years around 1991, we invented this idea of basically having modules that know how to forward propagate and back propagate gradients, and then interconnecting those modules in a graph. Number two had made proposals on this, about this in the late eighties, and we were able to implement this using our Lisp system. Eventually we wanted to use that system to build production code for character recognition at Bell Labs. So we actually wrote a compiler for that Lisp interpreter so that Patricia Simard, who is now at Microsoft, kind of did the bulk of it with Leon and me. And so we could write our system in Lisp and then compile to C, and then we'll have a self contained complete system that could kind of do the entire thing. Neither PyTorch nor TensorFlow can do this today. Yeah, okay, it's coming. Yeah. I mean, there's something like that in PyTorch called TorchScript. And so, you know, we had to write our Lisp interpreter, we had to write our Lisp compiler, we had to invest a huge amount of effort to do this. And not everybody, if you don't completely believe in the concept, you're not going to invest the time to do this. Now at the time also, you know, or today, this would turn into Torch or PyTorch or TensorFlow or whatever, we'd put it in open source, everybody would use it and, you know, realize it's good. Back before 1995, working at AT&T, there's no way the lawyers would let you release anything in open source of this nature. And so we could not distribute our code really. And on that point, and sorry to go on a million tangents, but on that point, I also read that there was some, almost like a patent on convolutional neural networks at Bell Labs. So that, first of all, I mean, just. There's two actually. That ran out. Thankfully, in 2007. In 2007. So I'm gonna, what, can we just talk about that for a second? I know you're a Facebook, but you're also at NYU. And what does it mean to patent ideas like these software ideas, essentially? Or what are mathematical ideas? Or what are they? Okay, so they're not mathematical ideas. They are, you know, algorithms. And there was a period where the US Patent Office would allow the patent of software as long as it was embodied. The Europeans are very different. They don't quite accept that. They have a different concept. But, you know, I don't, I no longer, I mean, I never actually strongly believed in this, but I don't believe in this kind of patent. Facebook basically doesn't believe in this kind of patent. Google fires patents because they've been burned with Apple. And so now they do this for defensive purpose, but usually they say, we're not gonna sue you if you infringe. Facebook has a similar policy. They say, you know, we fire patents on certain things for defensive purpose. We're not gonna sue you if you infringe, unless you sue us. So the industry does not believe in patents. They are there because of, you know, the legal landscape and various things. But I don't really believe in patents for this kind of stuff. So that's a great thing. So I... I'll tell you a worse story, actually. So what happens was the first patent about convolutional net was about kind of the early version of convolutional net that didn't have separate pooling layers. It had convolutional layers which tried more than one, if you want, right? And then there was a second one on convolutional nets with separate pooling layers, trained with backprop. And there were files filed in 89 and 1990 or something like this. At the time, the life of a patent was 17 years. So here's what happened over the next few years is that we started developing character recognition technology around convolutional nets. And in 1994, a check reading system was deployed in ATM machines. In 1995, it was for large check reading machines in back offices, et cetera. And those systems were developed by an engineering group that we were collaborating with at AT&T. And they were commercialized by NCR, which at the time was a subsidiary of AT&T. Now AT&T split up in 1996, early 1996. And the lawyers just looked at all the patents and they distributed the patents among the various companies. They gave the convolutional net patent to NCR because they were actually selling products that used it. But nobody at NCR had any idea what a convolutional net was. Yeah. Okay. So between 1996 and 2007, so there's a whole period until 2002 where I didn't actually work on machine learning or convolutional net. I resumed working on this around 2002. And between 2002 and 2007, I was working on them, crossing my finger that nobody at NCR would notice. Nobody noticed. Yeah, and I hope that this kind of somewhat, as you said, lawyers aside, relative openness of the community now will continue. It accelerates the entire progress of the industry. And the problems that Facebook and Google and others are facing today is not whether Facebook or Google or Microsoft or IBM or whoever is ahead of the other. It's that we don't have the technology to build the things we want to build. We want to build intelligent virtual assistants that have common sense. We don't have monopoly on good ideas for this. We don't believe we do. Maybe others believe they do, but we don't. Okay. If a startup tells you they have the secret to human level intelligence and common sense, don't believe them, they don't. And it's gonna take the entire work of the world research community for a while to get to the point where you can go off and each of those companies kind of start to build things on this. We're not there yet. It's absolutely, and this calls to the gap between the space of ideas and the rigorous testing of those ideas of practical application that you often speak to. You've written advice saying don't get fooled by people who claim to have a solution to artificial general intelligence, who claim to have an AI system that works just like the human brain or who claim to have figured out how the brain works. Ask them what the error rate they get on MNIST or ImageNet. So this is a little dated by the way. 2000, I mean five years, who's counting? Okay, but I think your opinion is still, MNIST and ImageNet, yes, may be dated, there may be new benchmarks, right? But I think that philosophy is one you still in somewhat hold, that benchmarks and the practical testing, the practical application is where you really get to test the ideas. Well, it may not be completely practical. Like for example, it could be a toy data set, but it has to be some sort of task that the community as a whole has accepted as some sort of standard kind of benchmark if you want. It doesn't need to be real. So for example, many years ago here at FAIR, people, Jason West and Antoine Borne and a few others proposed the Babi tasks, which were kind of a toy problem to test the ability of machines to reason actually to access working memory and things like this. And it was very useful even though it wasn't a real task. MNIST is kind of halfway real task. So toy problems can be very useful. It's just that I was really struck by the fact that a lot of people, particularly a lot of people with money to invest would be fooled by people telling them, oh, we have the algorithm of the cortex and you should give us 50 million. Yes, absolutely. So there's a lot of people who try to take advantage of the hype for business reasons and so on. But let me sort of talk to this idea that sort of new ideas, the ideas that push the field forward may not yet have a benchmark or it may be very difficult to establish a benchmark. I agree. That's part of the process. Establishing benchmarks is part of the process. So what are your thoughts about, so we have these benchmarks on around stuff we can do with images from classification to captioning to just every kind of information you can pull off from images and the surface level. There's audio data sets, there's some video. What can we start, natural language, what kind of stuff, what kind of benchmarks do you see that start creeping on to more something like intelligence, like reasoning, like maybe you don't like the term, but AGI echoes of that kind of formulation. A lot of people are working on interactive environments in which you can train and test intelligence systems. So there, for example, it's the classical paradigm of supervised learning is that you have a data set, you partition it into a training set, validation set, test set, and there's a clear protocol, right? But what if that assumes that the samples are statistically independent, you can exchange them, the order in which you see them shouldn't matter, things like that. But what if the answer you give determines the next sample you see, which is the case, for example, in robotics, right? You robot does something and then it gets exposed to a new room, and depending on where it goes, the room would be different. So that creates the exploration problem. The what if the samples, so that creates also a dependency between samples, right? You, if you move, if you can only move in space, the next sample you're gonna see is gonna be probably in the same building, most likely, right? So all the assumptions about the validity of this training set, test set hypothesis break. Whenever a machine can take an action that has an influence in the world, and it's what it's gonna see. So people are setting up artificial environments where that takes place, right? The robot runs around a 3D model of a house and can interact with objects and things like this. So you do robotics based simulation, you have those opening a gym type thing or Mujoko kind of simulated robots and you have games, things like that. So that's where the field is going really, this kind of environment. Now, back to the question of AGI. I don't like the term AGI because it implies that human intelligence is general and human intelligence is nothing like general. It's very, very specialized. We think it's general. We'd like to think of ourselves as having general intelligence. We don't, we're very specialized. We're only slightly more general than. Why does it feel general? So you kind of, the term general. I think what's impressive about humans is ability to learn, as we were talking about learning, to learn in just so many different domains. It's perhaps not arbitrarily general, but just you can learn in many domains and integrate that knowledge somehow. Okay. The knowledge persists. So let me take a very specific example. Yes. It's not an example. It's more like a quasi mathematical demonstration. So you have about 1 million fibers coming out of one of your eyes. Okay, 2 million total, but let's talk about just one of them. It's 1 million nerve fibers, your optical nerve. Let's imagine that they are binary. So they can be active or inactive, right? So the input to your visual cortex is 1 million bits. Mm hmm. Now they're connected to your brain in a particular way, and your brain has connections that are kind of a little bit like a convolutional net, they're kind of local, you know, in space and things like this. Now, imagine I play a trick on you. It's a pretty nasty trick, I admit. I cut your optical nerve, and I put a device that makes a random perturbation of a permutation of all the nerve fibers. So now what comes to your brain is a fixed but random permutation of all the pixels. There's no way in hell that your visual cortex, even if I do this to you in infancy, will actually learn vision to the same level of quality that you can. Got it, and you're saying there's no way you've learned that? No, because now two pixels that are nearby in the world will end up in very different places in your visual cortex, and your neurons there have no connections with each other because they're only connected locally. So this whole, our entire, the hardware is built in many ways to support? The locality of the real world. Yes, that's specialization. Yeah, but it's still pretty damn impressive, so it's not perfect generalization, it's not even close. No, no, it's not that it's not even close, it's not at all. Yeah, it's not, it's specialized, yeah. So how many Boolean functions? So let's imagine you want to train your visual system to recognize particular patterns of those one million bits. Okay, so that's a Boolean function, right? Either the pattern is here or not here, this is a two way classification with one million binary inputs. How many such Boolean functions are there? Okay, you have two to the one million combinations of inputs, for each of those you have an output bit, and so you have two to the one million Boolean functions of this type, okay? Which is an unimaginably large number. How many of those functions can actually be computed by your visual cortex? And the answer is a tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny sliver. Like an enormously tiny sliver. Yeah, yeah. So we are ridiculously specialized. Okay. But, okay, that's an argument against the word general. I think there's a, I agree with your intuition, but I'm not sure it's, it seems the brain is impressively capable of adjusting to things, so. It's because we can't imagine tasks that are outside of our comprehension, right? So we think we're general because we're general of all the things that we can apprehend. But there is a huge world out there of things that we have no idea. We call that heat, by the way. Heat. Heat. So, at least physicists call that heat, or they call it entropy, which is kind of. You have a thing full of gas, right? Closed system for gas. Right? Closed or not closed. It has pressure, it has temperature, it has, you know, and you can write equations, PV equal N on T, you know, things like that, right? When you reduce the volume, the temperature goes up, the pressure goes up, you know, things like that, right? For perfect gas, at least. Those are the things you can know about that system. And it's a tiny, tiny number of bits compared to the complete information of the state of the entire system. Because the state of the entire system will give you the position of momentum of every molecule of the gas. And what you don't know about it is the entropy, and you interpret it as heat. The energy contained in that thing is what we call heat. Now, it's very possible that, in fact, there is some very strong structure in how those molecules are moving. It's just that they are in a way that we are just not wired to perceive. Yeah, we're ignorant to it. And there's, in your infinite amount of things, we're not wired to perceive. And you're right, that's a nice way to put it. We're general to all the things we can imagine, which is a very tiny subset of all things that are possible. So it's like comograph complexity or the comograph chitin sum of complexity. Yeah. You know, every bit string or every integer is random, except for all the ones that you can actually write down. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, okay. So beautifully put. But, you know, so we can just call it artificial intelligence. We don't need to have a general. Or human level. Human level intelligence is good. You know, you'll start, anytime you touch human, it gets interesting because, you know, it's because we attach ourselves to human and it's difficult to define what human intelligence is. Yeah. Nevertheless, my definition is maybe dem impressive intelligence, okay? Dem impressive demonstration of intelligence, whatever. And so on that topic, most successes in deep learning have been in supervised learning. What is your view on unsupervised learning? Is there a hope to reduce involvement of human input and still have successful systems that have practical use? Yeah, I mean, there's definitely a hope. It's more than a hope, actually. It's mounting evidence for it. And that's basically all I do. Like, the only thing I'm interested in at the moment is, I call it self supervised learning, not unsupervised. Because unsupervised learning is a loaded term. People who know something about machine learning, you know, tell you, so you're doing clustering or PCA, which is not the case. And the white public, you know, when you say unsupervised learning, oh my God, machines are gonna learn by themselves without supervision. You know, they see this as... Where's the parents? Yeah, so I call it self supervised learning because, in fact, the underlying algorithms that are used are the same algorithms as the supervised learning algorithms, except that what we train them to do is not predict a particular set of variables, like the category of an image, and not to predict a set of variables that have been provided by human labelers. But what you're trying the machine to do is basically reconstruct a piece of its input that is being maxed out, essentially. You can think of it this way, right? So show a piece of video to a machine and ask it to predict what's gonna happen next. And of course, after a while, you can show what happens and the machine will kind of train itself to do better at that task. You can do like all the latest, most successful models in natural language processing, use self supervised learning. You know, sort of BERT style systems, for example, right? You show it a window of a dozen words on a text corpus, you take out 15% of the words, and then you train the machine to predict the words that are missing, that self supervised learning. It's not predicting the future, it's just predicting things in the middle, but you could have it predict the future, that's what language models do. So you construct, so in an unsupervised way, you construct a model of language. Do you think... Or video or the physical world or whatever, right? How far do you think that can take us? Do you think BERT understands anything? To some level, it has a shallow understanding of text, but it needs to, I mean, to have kind of true human level intelligence, I think you need to ground language in reality. So some people are attempting to do this, right? Having systems that kind of have some visual representation of what is being talked about, which is one reason you need those interactive environments actually. But this is like a huge technical problem that is not solved, and that explains why self supervised learning works in the context of natural language, but does not work in the context, or at least not well, in the context of image recognition and video, although it's making progress quickly. And the reason, that reason is the fact that it's much easier to represent uncertainty in the prediction in a context of natural language than it is in the context of things like video and images. So for example, if I ask you to predict what words are missing, 15% of the words that I've taken out. The possibilities are small. That means... It's small, right? There is 100,000 words in the lexicon, and what the machine spits out is a big probability vector, right? It's a bunch of numbers between zero and one that sum to one. And we know how to do this with computers. So there, representing uncertainty in the prediction is relatively easy, and that's, in my opinion, why those techniques work for NLP. For images, if you ask... If you block a piece of an image, and you ask the system, reconstruct that piece of the image, there are many possible answers. They are all perfectly legit, right? And how do you represent this set of possible answers? You can't train a system to make one prediction. You can't train a neural net to say, here it is, that's the image, because there's a whole set of things that are compatible with it. So how do you get the machine to represent not a single output, but a whole set of outputs? And similarly with video prediction, there's a lot of things that can happen in the future of video. You're looking at me right now. I'm not moving my head very much, but I might turn my head to the left or to the right. If you don't have a system that can predict this, and you train it with least square to minimize the error with the prediction and what I'm doing, what you get is a blurry image of myself in all possible future positions that I might be in, which is not a good prediction. So there might be other ways to do the self supervision for visual scenes. Like what? I mean, if I knew, I wouldn't tell you, publish it first, I don't know. No, there might be. So I mean, these are kind of, there might be artificial ways of like self play in games, the way you can simulate part of the environment. Oh, that doesn't solve the problem. It's just a way of generating data. But because you have more of a control, like maybe you can control, yeah, it's a way to generate data. That's right. And because you can do huge amounts of data generation, that doesn't, you're right. Well, it creeps up on the problem from the side of data, and you don't think that's the right way to creep up. It doesn't solve this problem of handling uncertainty in the world, right? So if you have a machine learn a predictive model of the world in a game that is deterministic or quasi deterministic, it's easy, right? Just give a few frames of the game to a ConvNet, put a bunch of layers, and then have the game generates the next few frames. And if the game is deterministic, it works fine. And that includes feeding the system with the action that your little character is gonna take. The problem comes from the fact that the real world and most games are not entirely predictable. And so there you get those blurry predictions and you can't do planning with blurry predictions, right? So if you have a perfect model of the world, you can, in your head, run this model with a hypothesis for a sequence of actions, and you're going to predict the outcome of that sequence of actions. But if your model is imperfect, how can you plan? Yeah, it quickly explodes. What are your thoughts on the extension of this, which topic I'm super excited about, it's connected to something you were talking about in terms of robotics, is active learning. So as opposed to sort of completely unsupervised or self supervised learning, you ask the system for human help for selecting parts you want annotated next. So if you think about a robot exploring a space or a baby exploring a space or a system exploring a data set, every once in a while asking for human input, do you see value in that kind of work? I don't see transformative value. It's going to make things that we can already do more efficient or they will learn slightly more efficiently, but it's not going to make machines sort of significantly more intelligent. I think, and by the way, there is no opposition, there's no conflict between self supervised learning, reinforcement learning and supervised learning or imitation learning or active learning. I see self supervised learning as a preliminary to all of the above. Yes. So the example I use very often is how is it that, so if you use classical reinforcement learning, deep reinforcement learning, if you want, the best methods today, so called model free reinforcement learning to learn to play Atari games, take about 80 hours of training to reach the level that any human can reach in about 15 minutes. They get better than humans, but it takes them a long time. Alpha star, okay, the, you know, Aureal Vinyals and his teams, the system to play StarCraft plays, you know, a single map, a single type of player. A single player and can reach better than human level with about the equivalent of 200 years of training playing against itself. It's 200 years, right? It's not something that no human can ever do. I mean, I'm not sure what lesson to take away from that. Okay, now take those algorithms, the best algorithms we have today to train a car to drive itself. It would probably have to drive millions of hours. It will have to kill thousands of pedestrians. It will have to run into thousands of trees. It will have to run off cliffs. And it had to run off cliff multiple times before it figures out that it's a bad idea, first of all. And second of all, before it figures out how not to do it. And so, I mean, this type of learning obviously does not reflect the kind of learning that animals and humans do. There is something missing that's really, really important there. And my hypothesis, which I've been advocating for like five years now, is that we have predictive models of the world that include the ability to predict under uncertainty. And what allows us to not run off a cliff when we learn to drive, most of us can learn to drive in about 20 or 30 hours of training without ever crashing, causing any accident. And if we drive next to a cliff, we know that if we turn the wheel to the right, the car is gonna run off the cliff and nothing good is gonna come out of this. Because we have a pretty good model of intuitive physics that tells us the car is gonna fall. We know about gravity. Babies learn this around the age of eight or nine months that objects don't float, they fall. And we have a pretty good idea of the effect of turning the wheel on the car and we know we need to stay on the road. So there's a lot of things that we bring to the table, which is basically our predictive model of the world. And that model allows us to not do stupid things. And to basically stay within the context of things we need to do. We still face unpredictable situations and that's how we learn. But that allows us to learn really, really, really quickly. So that's called model based reinforcement learning. There's some imitation and supervised learning because we have a driving instructor that tells us occasionally what to do. But most of the learning is learning the model, learning physics that we've done since we were babies. That's where all, almost all the learning. And the physics is somewhat transferable from, it's transferable from scene to scene. Stupid things are the same everywhere. Yeah, I mean, if you have experience of the world, you don't need to be from a particularly intelligent species to know that if you spill water from a container, the rest is gonna get wet. You might get wet. So cats know this, right? Yeah. Right, so the main problem we need to solve is how do we learn models of the world? That's what I'm interested in. That's what self supervised learning is all about. If you were to try to construct a benchmark for, let's look at MNIST. I love that data set. Do you think it's useful, interesting, slash possible to perform well on MNIST with just one example of each digit and how would we solve that problem? The answer is probably yes. The question is what other type of learning are you allowed to do? So if what you're allowed to do is train on some gigantic data set of labeled digit, that's called transfer learning. And we know that works, okay? We do this at Facebook, like in production, right? We train large convolutional nets to predict hashtags that people type on Instagram and we train on billions of images, literally billions. And then we chop off the last layer and fine tune on whatever task we want. That works really well. You can beat the ImageNet record with this. We actually open sourced the whole thing like a few weeks ago. Yeah, that's still pretty cool. But yeah, so what would be impressive? What's useful and impressive? What kind of transfer learning would be useful and impressive? Is it Wikipedia, that kind of thing? No, no, so I don't think transfer learning is really where we should focus. We should try to do, you know, have a kind of scenario for Benchmark where you have unlabeled data and you can, and it's very large number of unlabeled data. It could be video clips. It could be where you do, you know, frame prediction. It could be images where you could choose to, you know, mask a piece of it, could be whatever, but they're unlabeled and you're not allowed to label them. So you do some training on this, and then you train on a particular supervised task, ImageNet or a NIST, and you measure how your test error decrease or validation error decreases as you increase the number of label training samples. Okay, and what you'd like to see is that, you know, your error decreases much faster than if you train from scratch from random weights. So that to reach the same level of performance and a completely supervised, purely supervised system would reach you would need way fewer samples. So that's the crucial question because it will answer the question to like, you know, people interested in medical image analysis. Okay, you know, if I want to get to a particular level of error rate for this task, I know I need a million samples. Can I do, you know, self supervised pre training to reduce this to about 100 or something? And you think the answer there is self supervised pre training? Yeah, some form, some form of it. Telling you active learning, but you disagree. No, it's not useless. It's just not gonna lead to a quantum leap. It's just gonna make things that we already do. So you're way smarter than me. I just disagree with you. But I don't have anything to back that. It's just intuition. So I worked a lot of large scale data sets and there's something that might be magic in active learning, but okay. And at least I said it publicly. At least I'm being an idiot publicly. Okay. It's not being an idiot. It's, you know, working with the data you have. I mean, I mean, certainly people are doing things like, okay, I have 3000 hours of, you know, imitation learning for start driving car,\n",

      "Text: What difference between biological neural networks and artificial neural networks is most mysterious, captivating, and profound for you? First of all, there's so much we don't know about biological neural networks, and that's very mysterious and captivating because maybe it holds the key to improving artificial neural networks. One of the things I studied recently is something that we don't know how biological neural networks do but would be really useful for artificial ones is the ability to do credit assignment through very long time spans. There are things that we can in principle do with artificial neural nets, but it's not very convenient and it's not biologically plausible. And this mismatch, I think this kind of mismatch may be an interesting thing to study to, A, understand better how brains might do these things because we don't have good corresponding theories with artificial neural nets, and B, maybe provide new ideas that we could explore about things that brain do differently and that we could incorporate in artificial neural nets. So let's break credit assignment up a little bit. Yes. So what, it's a beautifully technical term, but it could incorporate so many things. So is it more on the RNN memory side, that thinking like that, or is it something about knowledge, building up common sense knowledge over time? Or is it more in the reinforcement learning sense that you're picking up rewards over time for a particular, to achieve a certain kind of goal? So I was thinking more about the first two meanings whereby we store all kinds of memories, episodic memories in our brain, which we can access later in order to help us both infer causes of things that we are observing now and assign credit to decisions or interpretations we came up with a while ago when those memories were stored. And then we can change the way we would have reacted or interpreted things in the past, and now that's credit assignment used for learning. So in which way do you think artificial neural networks, the current LSTM, the current architectures are not able to capture the, presumably you're thinking of very long term? Yes. So current, the current nets are doing a fairly good jobs for sequences with dozens or say hundreds of time steps. And then it gets harder and harder and depending on what you have to remember and so on, as you consider longer durations. Whereas humans seem to be able to do credit assignment through essentially arbitrary times, like I could remember something I did last year. And then now because I see some new evidence, I'm going to change my mind about the way I was thinking last year. And hopefully not do the same mistake again. I think a big part of that is probably forgetting. You're only remembering the really important things. It's very efficient forgetting. Yes. So there's a selection of what we remember. And I think there are really cool connection to higher level cognition here regarding consciousness, deciding and emotions, so deciding what comes to consciousness and what gets stored in memory, which are not trivial either. So you've been at the forefront there all along, showing some of the amazing things that neural networks, deep neural networks can do in the field of artificial intelligence is just broadly in all kinds of applications. But we can talk about that forever. But what, in your view, because we're thinking towards the future, is the weakest aspect of the way deep neural networks represent the world? What is that? What is in your view is missing? So current state of the art neural nets trained on large quantities of images or texts have some level of understanding of, you know, what explains those data sets, but it's very basic, it's it's very low level. And it's not nearly as robust and abstract and general as our understanding. Okay, so that doesn't tell us how to fix things. But I think it encourages us to think about how we can maybe train our neural nets differently, so that they would focus, for example, on causal explanation, something that we don't do currently with neural net training. Also, one thing I'll talk about in my talk this afternoon is the fact that instead of learning separately from images and videos on one hand and from texts on the other hand, we need to do a better job of jointly learning about language and about the world to which it refers. So that, you know, both sides can help each other. We need to have good world models in our neural nets for them to really understand sentences, which talk about what's going on in the world. And I think we need language input to help provide clues about what high level concepts like semantic concepts should be represented at the top levels of our neural nets. In fact, there is evidence that the purely unsupervised learning of representations doesn't give rise to high level representations that are as powerful as the ones we're getting from supervised learning. And so the clues we're getting just with the labels, not even sentences, is already very, very high level. And I think that's a very important thing to keep in mind. It's already very powerful. Do you think that's an architecture challenge or is it a data set challenge? Neither. I'm tempted to just end it there. Can you elaborate slightly? Of course, data sets and architectures are something you want to always play with. But I think the crucial thing is more the training objectives, the training frameworks. For example, going from passive observation of data to more active agents, which learn by intervening in the world, the relationships between causes and effects, the sort of objective functions, which could be important to allow the highest level explanations to rise from the learning, which I don't think we have now, the kinds of objective functions, which could be used to reward exploration, the right kind of exploration. So these kinds of questions are neither in the data set nor in the architecture, but more in how we learn, under what objectives and so on. Yeah, I've heard you mention in several contexts, the idea of sort of the way children learn, they interact with objects in the world. And it seems fascinating because in some sense, except with some cases in reinforcement learning, that idea is not part of the learning process in artificial neural networks. So it's almost like, do you envision something like an objective function saying, you know what, if you poke this object in this kind of way, it would be really helpful for me to further learn. Right, right. Sort of almost guiding some aspect of the learning. Right, right, right. So I was talking to Rebecca Sacks just a few minutes ago, and she was talking about lots and lots of evidence from infants seem to clearly pick what interests them in a directed way. And so they're not passive learners, they focus their attention on aspects of the world, which are most interesting, surprising in a non trivial way. That makes them change their theories of the world. So that's a fascinating view of the future progress. But on a more maybe boring question, do you think going deeper and larger, so do you think just increasing the size of the things that have been increasing a lot in the past few years, is going to be a big thing? I think increasing the size of the things that have been increasing a lot in the past few years will also make significant progress. So some of the representational issues that you mentioned, they're kind of shallow, in some sense. Oh, shallow in the sense of abstraction. In the sense of abstraction, they're not getting some... I don't think that having more depth in the network in the sense of instead of 100 layers, you're going to have more layers. I don't think so. Is that obvious to you? Yes. What is clear to me is that engineers and companies and labs and grad students will continue to tune architectures and explore all kinds of tweaks to make the current state of the art slightly ever slightly better. But I don't think that's going to be nearly enough. I think we need changes in the way that we're considering learning to achieve the goal that these learners actually understand in a deep way the environment in which they are, you know, observing and acting. But I guess I was trying to ask a question that's more interesting than just more layers. It's basically, once you figure out a way to learn through interacting, how many parameters it takes to store that information. So I think our brain is quite bigger than most neural networks. Right, right. Oh, I see what you mean. Oh, I'm with you there. So I agree that in order to build neural nets with the kind of broad knowledge of the world that typical adult humans have, probably the kind of computing power we have now is going to be insufficient. So the good news is there are hardware companies building neural net chips. And so it's going to get better. However, the good news in a way, which is also a bad news, is that even our state of the art, deep learning methods fail to learn models that understand even very simple environments, like some grid worlds that we have built. Even these fairly simple environments, I mean, of course, if you train them with enough examples, eventually they get it. But it's just like, instead of what humans might need just dozens of examples, these things will need millions for very, very, very simple tasks. And so I think there's an opportunity for academics who don't have the kind of computing power that, say, Google has to do really important and exciting research to advance the state of the art in training frameworks, learning models, agent learning in even simple environments that are synthetic, that seem trivial, but yet current machine learning fails on. We talked about priors and common sense knowledge. It seems like we humans take a lot of knowledge for granted. So what's your view of these priors of forming this broad view of the world, this accumulation of information and how we can teach neural networks or learning systems to pick that knowledge up? So knowledge, for a while, the artificial intelligence was maybe in the 80s, like there's a time where knowledge representation, knowledge, acquisition, expert systems, I mean, the symbolic AI was a view, was an interesting problem set to solve and it was kind of put on hold a little bit, it seems like. Because it doesn't work. It doesn't work. That's right. But that's right. But the goals of that remain important. Yes. Remain important. And how do you think those goals can be addressed? Right. So first of all, I believe that one reason why the classical expert systems approach failed is because a lot of the knowledge we have, so you talked about common sense intuition, there's a lot of knowledge like this, which is not consciously accessible. There are lots of decisions we're taking that we can't really explain, even if sometimes we make up a story. And that knowledge is also necessary for machines to take good decisions. And that knowledge is hard to codify in expert systems, rule based systems and classical AI formalism. And there are other issues, of course, with the old AI, like not really good ways of handling uncertainty, I would say something more subtle, which we understand better now, but I think still isn't enough in the minds of people. There's something really powerful that comes from distributed representations, the thing that really makes neural nets work so well. And it's hard to replicate that kind of power in a symbolic world. The knowledge in expert systems and so on is nicely decomposed into like a bunch of rules. Whereas if you think about a neural net, it's the opposite. You have this big blob of parameters which work intensely together to represent everything the network knows. And it's not sufficiently factorized. It's not sufficiently factorized. And so I think this is one of the weaknesses of current neural nets, that we have to take lessons from classical AI in order to bring in another kind of compositionality, which is common in language, for example, and in these rules, but that isn't so native to neural nets. And on that line of thinking, disentangled representations. Yes. So let me connect with disentangled representations, if you might, if you don't mind. So for many years, I've thought, and I still believe that it's really important that we come up with learning algorithms, either unsupervised or supervised, but reinforcement, whatever, that build representations in which the important factors, hopefully causal factors are nicely separated and easy to pick up from the representation. So that's the idea of disentangled representations. It says transform the data into a space where everything becomes easy. We can maybe just learn with linear models about the things we care about. And I still think this is important, but I think this is missing out on a very important ingredient, which classical AI systems can remind us of. So let's say we have these disentangled representations. You still need to learn about the relationships between the variables, those high level semantic variables. They're not going to be independent. I mean, this is like too much of an assumption. They're going to have some interesting relationships that allow to predict things in the future, to explain what happened in the past. The kind of knowledge about those relationships in a classical AI system is encoded in the rules. Like a rule is just like a little piece of knowledge that says, oh, I have these two, three, four variables that are linked in this interesting way, then I can say something about one or two of them given a couple of others, right? In addition to disentangling the elements of the representation, which are like the variables in a rule based system, you also need to disentangle the mechanisms that relate those variables to each other. So like the rules. So the rules are neatly separated. Like each rule is, you know, living on its own. And when I change a rule because I'm learning, it doesn't need to break other rules. Whereas current neural nets, for example, are very sensitive to what's called catastrophic forgetting, where after I've learned some things and then I learn new things, they can destroy the old things that I had learned, right? If the knowledge was better factorized and separated, disentangled, then you would avoid a lot of that. Now, you can't do this in the sensory domain. What do you mean by sensory domain? Like in pixel space. But my idea is that when you project the data in the right semantic space, it becomes possible to now represent this extra knowledge beyond the transformation from inputs to representations, which is how representations act on each other and predict the future and so on in a way that can be neatly disentangled. So now it's the rules that are disentangled from each other and not just the variables that are disentangled from each other. And you draw a distinction between semantic space and pixel, like does there need to be an architectural difference? Well, yeah. So there's the sensory space like pixels, which where everything is entangled. The information, like the variables are completely interdependent in very complicated ways. And also computation, like it's not just the variables, it's also how they are related to each other is all intertwined. But I'm hypothesizing that in the right high level representation space, both the variables and how they relate to each other can be disentangled. And that will provide a lot of generalization power. Generalization power. Yes. Distribution of the test set is assumed to be the same as the distribution of the training set. Right. This is where current machine learning is too weak. It doesn't tell us anything, is not able to tell us anything about how our neural nets, say, are going to generalize to a new distribution. And, you know, people may think, well, but there's nothing we can say if we don't know what the new distribution will be. The truth is humans are able to generalize to new distributions. Yeah. How are we able to do that? Yeah. Because there is something, these new distributions, even though they could look very different from the training distributions, they have things in common. So let me give you a concrete example. You read a science fiction novel. The science fiction novel, maybe, you know, brings you in some other planet where things look very different on the surface, but it's still the same laws of physics. And so you can read the book and you understand what's going on. So the distribution is very different. But because you can transport a lot of the knowledge you had from Earth about the underlying cause and effect relationships and physical mechanisms and all that, and maybe even social interactions, you can now make sense of what is going on on this planet where, like, visually, for example, things are totally different. Taking that analogy further and distorting it, let's enter a science fiction world of, say, Space Odyssey, 2001, with Hal. Or maybe, which is probably one of my favorite AI movies. Me too. And then there's another one that a lot of people love that may be a little bit outside of the AI community is Ex Machina. I don't know if you've seen it. Yes. Yes. By the way, what are your views on that movie? Are you able to enjoy it? Are there things I like and things I hate? So you could talk about that in the context of a question I want to ask, which is, there's quite a large community of people from different backgrounds, often outside of AI, who are concerned about existential threat of artificial intelligence. You've seen this community develop over time. You've seen you have a perspective. So what do you think is the best way to talk about AI safety, to think about it, to have discourse about it within AI community and outside and grounded in the fact that Ex Machina is one of the main sources of information for the general public about AI? So I think you're putting it right. There's a big difference between the sort of discussion we ought to have within the AI community and the sort of discussion that really matter in the general public. So I think the picture of Terminator and AI loose and killing people and super intelligence that's going to destroy us, whatever we try, isn't really so useful for the public discussion. Because for the public discussion, the things I believe really matter are the short term and medium term, very likely negative impacts of AI on society, whether it's from security, like, you know, big brother scenarios with face recognition or killer robots, or the impact on the job market, or concentration of power and discrimination, all kinds of social issues, which could actually, some of them could really threaten democracy, for example. Just to clarify, when you said killer robots, you mean autonomous weapon, weapon systems. Yes, I don't mean that's right. So I think these short and medium term concerns should be important parts of the public debate. Now, existential risk, for me is a very unlikely consideration, but still worth academic investigation in the same way that you could say, should we study what could happen if meteorite, you know, came to earth and destroyed it. So I think it's very unlikely that this is going to happen in or happen in a reasonable future. The sort of scenario of an AI getting loose goes against my understanding of at least current machine learning and current neural nets and so on. It's not plausible to me. But of course, I don't have a crystal ball and who knows what AI will be in 50 years from now. So I think it is worth that scientists study those problems. It's just not a pressing question as far as I'm concerned. So before I continue down that line, I have a few questions there. But what do you like and not like about Ex Machina as a movie? Because I actually watched it for the second time and enjoyed it. I hated it the first time, and I enjoyed it quite a bit more the second time when I sort of learned to accept certain pieces of it, see it as a concept movie. What was your experience? What were your thoughts? So the negative is the picture it paints of science is totally wrong. Science in general and AI in particular. Science is not happening in some hidden place by some, you know, really smart guy, one person. This is totally unrealistic. This is not how it happens. Even a team of people in some isolated place will not make it. Science moves by small steps, thanks to the collaboration and community of a large number of people interacting. And all the scientists who are expert in their field kind of know what is going on, even in the industrial labs. It's information flows and leaks and so on. And the spirit of it is very different from the way science is painted in this movie. Yeah, let me ask on that point. It's been the case to this point that kind of even if the research happens inside Google or Facebook, inside companies, it still kind of comes out, ideas come out. Do you think that will always be the case with AI? Is it possible to bottle ideas to the point where there's a set of breakthroughs that go completely undiscovered by the general research community? Do you think that's even possible? It's possible, but it's unlikely. It's not how it is done now. It's not how I can foresee it in the foreseeable future. But of course, I don't have a crystal ball and science is a crystal ball. And so who knows? This is science fiction after all. I think it's ominous that the lights went off during that discussion. So the problem, again, there's one thing is the movie and you could imagine all kinds of science fiction. The problem for me, maybe similar to the question about existential risk, is that this kind of movie paints such a wrong picture of what is the actual science and how it's going on that it can have unfortunate effects on people's understanding of current science. And so that's kind of sad. There's an important principle in research, which is diversity. So in other words, research is exploration. Research is exploration in the space of ideas. And different people will focus on different directions. And this is not just good, it's essential. So I'm totally fine with people exploring directions that are contrary to mine or look orthogonal to mine. I am more than fine. I think it's important. I and my friends don't claim we have universal truth about what will, especially about what will happen in the future. Now that being said, we have our intuitions and then we act accordingly according to where we think we can be most useful and where society has the most to gain or to lose. We should have those debates and not end up in a society where there's only one voice and one way of thinking and research money is spread out. So disagreement is a sign of good research, good science. Yes. The idea of bias in the human sense of bias. How do you think about instilling in machine learning something that's aligned with human values in terms of bias? We intuitively as human beings have a concept of what bias means, of what fundamental respect for other human beings means. But how do we instill that into machine learning systems, do you think? So I think there are short term things that are already happening and then there are long term things that we need to do. In the short term, there are techniques that have been proposed and I think will continue to be improved and maybe alternatives will come up to take data sets in which we know there is bias, we can measure it. Pretty much any data set where humans are being observed taking decisions will have some sort of bias, discrimination against particular groups and so on. And we can use machine learning techniques to try to build predictors, classifiers that are going to be less biased. We can do it, for example, using adversarial methods to make our systems less sensitive to these variables we should not be sensitive to. So these are clear, well defined ways of trying to address the problem. Maybe they have weaknesses and more research is needed and so on. But I think in fact they are sufficiently mature that governments should start regulating companies where it matters, say like insurance companies, so that they use those techniques. Because those techniques will probably reduce the bias but at a cost. For example, maybe their predictions will be less accurate and so companies will not do it until you force them. All right, so this is short term. Long term, I'm really interested in thinking how we can instill moral values into computers. Obviously, this is not something we'll achieve in the next five or 10 years. How can we, you know, there's already work in detecting emotions, for example, in images, in sounds, in texts, and also studying how different agents interacting in different ways may correspond to patterns of, say, injustice, which could trigger anger. So these are things we can do in the medium term and eventually train computers to model, for example, how humans react emotionally. I would say the simplest thing is unfair situations which trigger anger. This is one of the most basic emotions that we share with other animals. I think it's quite feasible within the next few years that we can build systems that can detect these kinds of things to the extent, unfortunately, that they understand enough about the world around us, which is a long time away. But maybe we can initially do this in virtual environments. So you can imagine a video game where agents interact in some ways and then some situations trigger an emotion. I think we could train machines to detect those situations and predict that the particular emotion will likely be felt if a human was playing one of the characters. You have shown excitement and done a lot of excellent work with unsupervised learning. But there's been a lot of success on the supervised learning side. Yes, yes. And one of the things I'm really passionate about is how humans and robots work together. And in the context of supervised learning, that means the process of annotation. Do you think about the problem of annotation put in a more interesting way as humans teaching machines? Yes. Is there? Yes. I think it's an important subject. Reducing it to annotation may be useful for somebody building a system tomorrow. But longer term, the process of teaching, I think, is something that deserves a lot more attention from the machine learning community. So there are people who have coined the term machine teaching. So what are good strategies for teaching a learning agent? And can we design and train a system that is going to be a good teacher? So in my group, we have a project called BBI or BBI game, where there is a game or scenario where there's a learning agent and a teaching agent. Presumably, the teaching agent would eventually be a human. But we're not there yet. And the role of the teacher is to use its knowledge of the environment, which it can acquire using whatever way brute force to help the learner learn as quickly as possible. So the learner is going to try to learn by itself, maybe using some exploration and whatever. But the teacher can choose, can have an influence on the interaction with the learner, so as to guide the learner, maybe teach it the things that the learner has most trouble with, or just add the boundary between what it knows and doesn't know, and so on. So there's a tradition of these kind of ideas from other fields and like tutorial systems, for example, and AI. And of course, people in the humanities have been thinking about these questions. But I think it's time that machine learning people look at this, because in the future, we'll have more and more human machine interaction with the human in the loop. And I think understanding how to make this work better, all the problems around that are very interesting and not sufficiently addressed. You've done a lot of work with language, too. What aspect of the traditionally formulated Turing test, a test of natural language understanding and generation in your eyes is the most difficult of conversation? What in your eyes is the hardest part of conversation to solve for machines? So I would say it's everything having to do with the non linguistic knowledge, which implicitly you need in order to make sense of sentences, things like the Winograd schema. So these sentences that are semantically ambiguous. In other words, you need to understand enough about the world in order to really interpret properly those sentences. I think these are interesting challenges for machine learning, because they point in the direction of building systems that both understand how the world works and this causal relationships in the world and associate that knowledge with how to express it in language, either for reading or writing. You speak French? Yes, it's my mother tongue. It's one of the romance languages. Do you think passing the Turing test and all the underlying challenges we just mentioned depend on language? Do you think it might be easier in French than it is in English, or is independent of language? I think it's independent of language. I would like to build systems that can use the same principles, the same learning mechanisms to learn from human agents, whatever their language. Well, certainly us humans can talk more beautifully and smoothly in poetry, some Russian originally. I know poetry in Russian is maybe easier to convey complex ideas than it is in English. But maybe I'm showing my bias and some people could say that about French. But of course, the goal ultimately is our human brain is able to utilize any kind of those languages to use them as tools to convey meaning. Yeah, of course, there are differences between languages, and maybe some are slightly better at some things, but in the grand scheme of things, where we're trying to understand how the brain works and language and so on, I think these differences are minute. So you've lived perhaps through an AI winter of sorts? Yes. How did you stay warm and continue your research? Stay warm with friends. With friends. Okay, so it's important to have friends. And what have you learned from the experience? Listen to your inner voice. Don't, you know, be trying to just please the crowds and the fashion. And if you have a strong intuition about something that is not contradicted by actual evidence, go for it. I mean, it could be contradicted by people. Not your own instinct of based on everything you've learned? Of course, you have to adapt your beliefs when your experiments contradict those beliefs. But you have to stick to your beliefs. Otherwise, it's what allowed me to go through those years. It's what allowed me to persist in directions that, you know, took time, whatever other people think, took time to mature and bring fruits. So history of AI is marked with these, of course, it's marked with technical breakthroughs, but it's also marked with these seminal events that capture the imagination of the community. Most recent, I would say, AlphaGo beating the world champion human Go player was one of those moments. What do you think the next such moment might be? Okay, so first of all, I think that these so called seminal events are overrated. As I said, science really moves by small steps. Now what happens is you make one more small step and it's like the drop that, you know, that fills the bucket and then you have drastic consequences because now you're able to do something you were not able to do before. Or now, say, the cost of building some device or solving a problem becomes cheaper than what existed and you have a new market that opens up, right? So especially in the world of commerce and applications, the impact of a small scientific progress could be huge. But in the science itself, I think it's very, very gradual. And where are these steps being taken now? So there's unsupervised learning. So if I look at one trend that I like in my community, so for example, at Milan, my institute, what are the two hardest topics? GANs and reinforcement learning. Even though in Montreal in particular, reinforcement learning was something pretty much absent just two or three years ago. So there's really a big interest from students and there's a big interest from people like me. So I would say this is something where we're going to see more progress, even though it hasn't yet provided much in terms of actual industrial fallout. Like even though there's AlphaGo, there's no, like Google is not making money on this right now. But I think over the long term, this is really, really important for many reasons. So in other words, I would say reinforcement learning may be more generally agent learning because it doesn't have to be with rewards. It could be in all kinds of ways that an agent is learning about its environment. Now reinforcement learning you're excited about, do you think GANs could provide something, at the moment? Well, GANs or other generative models, I believe, will be crucial ingredients in building agents that can understand the world. A lot of the successes in reinforcement learning in the past has been with policy gradient, where you just learn a policy, you don't actually learn a model of the world. But there are lots of issues with that. And we don't know how to do model based RL right now. But I think this is where we have to go in order to build models that can generalize faster and better like to new distributions that capture to some extent, at least the underlying causal mechanisms in the world. Last question. What made you fall in love with artificial intelligence? If you look back, what was the first moment in your life when you were fascinated by either the human mind or the artificial mind? You know, when I was an adolescent, I was reading a lot. And then I started reading science fiction. There you go. That's it. That's where I got hooked. And then, you know, I had one of the first personal computers and I got hooked in programming. And so it just, you know, Start with fiction and then make it a reality. That's right. Yoshua, thank you so much for talking to me. My pleasure.\n",

      "Text: The following is a conversation with Daphne Koller, a professor of computer science at Stanford University, a cofounder of Coursera with Andrew Ng, and founder and CEO of Incitro, a company at the intersection of machine learning and biomedicine. We're now in the exciting early days of using the data driven methods of machine learning to help discover and develop new drugs and treatments at scale. Daphne and Incitro are leading the way on this with breakthroughs that may ripple through all fields of medicine, including ones most critical for helping with the current coronavirus pandemic. This conversation was recorded before the COVID 19 outbreak. For everyone feeling the medical, psychological, and financial burden of this crisis, I'm sending love your way. Stay strong, we're in this together, we'll beat this thing. This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast. If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube, review it with five stars on Apple Podcast, support it on Patreon, or simply connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N. As usual, I'll do a few minutes of ads now and never any ads in the middle that can break the flow of this conversation. I hope that works for you and doesn't hurt the listening experience. This show is presented by Cash App, the number one finance app in the app store. When you get it, use code LEXPODCAST. Cash App lets you send money to friends, buy Bitcoin, and invest in the stock market with as little as one dollar. Since Cash App allows you to send and receive money digitally, peer to peer, and security in all digital transactions is very important, let me mention the PCI data security standard that Cash App is compliant with. I'm a big fan of standards for safety and security. PCI DSS is a good example of that, where a bunch of competitors got together and agreed that there needs to be a global standard around the security of transactions. Now we just need to do the same for autonomous vehicles and AI systems in general. So again, if you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play and use the code LEXPODCAST, you get $10 and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST, an organization that is helping to advance robotics and STEM education for young people around the world. And now here's my conversation with Daphne Koller. So you cofounded Coursera and made a huge impact in the global education of AI. And after five years in August, 2016, wrote a blog post saying that you're stepping away and wrote, quote, it is time for me to turn to another critical challenge, the development of machine learning and its applications to improving human health. So let me ask two far out philosophical questions. One, do you think we'll one day find cures for all major diseases known today? And two, do you think we'll one day figure out a way to extend the human lifespan, perhaps to the point of immortality? So one day is a very long time and I don't like to make predictions of the type we will never be able to do X because I think that's a smacks of hubris. It seems that never in the entire eternity of human existence will we be able to solve a problem. That being said, curing disease is very hard because oftentimes by the time you discover the disease, a lot of damage has already been done. And so to assume that we would be able to cure disease at that stage assumes that we would come up with ways of basically regenerating entire parts of the human body in the way that actually returns it to its original state. And that's a very challenging problem. We have cured very few diseases. We've been able to provide treatment for an increasingly large number, but the number of things that you could actually define to be cures is actually not that large. So I think that there's a lot of work that would need to happen before one could legitimately say that we have cured even a reasonable number, far less all diseases. On the scale of zero to 100, where are we in understanding the fundamental mechanisms of all of major diseases? What's your sense? So from the computer science perspective that you've entered the world of health, how far along are we? I think it depends on which disease. I mean, there are ones where I would say we're maybe not quite at a hundred because biology is really complicated and there's always new things that we uncover that people didn't even realize existed. But I would say there's diseases where we might be in the 70s or 80s, and then there's diseases in which I would say with probably the majority where we're really close to zero. Would Alzheimer's and schizophrenia and type two diabetes fall closer to zero or to the 80? I think Alzheimer's is probably closer to zero than to 80. There are hypotheses, but I don't think those hypotheses have as of yet been sufficiently validated that we believe them to be true. And there is an increasing number of people who believe that the traditional hypotheses might not really explain what's going on. I would also say that Alzheimer's and schizophrenia and even type two diabetes are not really one disease. They're almost certainly a heterogeneous collection of mechanisms that manifest in clinically similar ways. So in the same way that we now understand that breast cancer is really not one disease, it is multitude of cellular mechanisms, all of which ultimately translate to uncontrolled proliferation, but it's not one disease. The same is almost undoubtedly true for those other diseases as well. And that understanding that needs to precede any understanding of the specific mechanisms of any of those other diseases. Now, in schizophrenia, I would say we're almost certainly closer to zero than to anything else. Type two diabetes is a bit of a mix. There are clear mechanisms that are implicated that I think have been validated that have to do with insulin resistance and such, but there's almost certainly there as well many mechanisms that we have not yet understood. You've also thought and worked a little bit on the longevity side. Do you see the disease and longevity as overlapping completely, partially, or not at all as efforts? Those mechanisms are certainly overlapping. There's a well known phenomenon that says that for most diseases, other than childhood diseases, the risk for contracting that disease increases exponentially year on year, every year from the time you're about 40. So obviously there's a connection between those two things. That's not to say that they're identical. There's clearly aging that happens that is not really associated with any specific disease. And there's also diseases and mechanisms of disease that are not specifically related to aging. So I think overlap is where we're at. Okay. It is a little unfortunate that we get older and it seems that there's some correlation with the occurrence of diseases or the fact that we get older. And both are quite sad. I mean, there's processes that happen as cells age that I think are contributing to disease. Some of those have to do with DNA damage that accumulates as cells divide where the repair mechanisms don't fully correct for those. There are accumulations of proteins that are misfolded and potentially aggregate and those too contribute to disease and will contribute to inflammation. There's a multitude of mechanisms that have been uncovered that are sort of wear and tear at the cellular level that contribute to disease processes and I'm sure there's many that we don't yet understand. On a small tangent and perhaps philosophical, the fact that things get older and the fact that things die is a very powerful feature for the growth of new things. It's a learning, it's a kind of learning mechanism. So it's both tragic and beautiful. So do you, so in trying to fight disease and trying to fight aging, do you think about sort of the useful fact of our mortality or would you, like if you were, could be immortal, would you choose to be immortal? Again, I think immortal is a very long time and I don't know that that would necessarily be something that I would want to aspire to but I think all of us aspire to an increased health span, I would say, which is an increased amount of time where you're healthy and active and feel as you did when you were 20 and we're nowhere close to that. People deteriorate physically and mentally over time and that is a very sad phenomenon. So I think a wonderful aspiration would be if we could all live to the biblical 120 maybe in perfect health. In high quality of life. High quality of life. I think that would be an amazing goal for us to achieve as a society now is the right age 120 or 100 or 150. I think that's up for debate but I think an increased health span is a really worthy goal. And anyway, in a grand time of the age of the universe, it's all pretty short. So from the perspective, you've done obviously a lot of incredible work in machine learning. So what role do you think data and machine learning play in this goal of trying to understand diseases and trying to eradicate diseases? Up until now, I don't think it's played very much of a significant role because largely the data sets that one really needed to enable a powerful machine learning methods, those data sets haven't really existed. There's been dribs and drabs and some interesting machine learning that has been applied, I would say machine learning slash data science, but the last few years are starting to change that. So we now see an increase in some large data sets but equally importantly, an increase in technologies that are able to produce data at scale. It's not typically the case that people have deliberately proactively used those tools for the purpose of generating data for machine learning. They, to the extent that those techniques have been used for data production, they've been used for data production to drive scientific discovery and the machine learning came as a sort of byproduct second stage of, oh, you know, now we have a data set, let's do machine learning on that rather than a more simplistic data analysis method. But what we are doing in Citro is actually flipping that around and saying, here's this incredible repertoire of methods that bioengineers, cell biologists have come up with, let's see if we can put them together in brand new ways with the goal of creating data sets that machine learning can really be applied on productively to create powerful predictive models that can help us address fundamental problems in human health. So really focus to get, make data the primary focus and the primary goal and find, use the mechanisms of biology and chemistry to create the kinds of data set that could allow machine learning to benefit the most. I wouldn't put it in those terms because that says that data is the end goal. Data is the means. So for us, the end goal is helping address challenges in human health and the method that we've elected to do that is to apply machine learning to build predictive models and machine learning, in my opinion, can only be really successfully applied especially the more powerful models if you give it data that is of sufficient scale and sufficient quality. So how do you create those data sets so as to drive the ability to generate predictive models which subsequently help improve human health? So before we dive into the details of that, let me take a step back and ask when and where was your interest in human health born? Are there moments, events, perhaps if I may ask, tragedies in your own life that catalyzes passion or was it the broader desire to help humankind? So I would say it's a bit of both. So on, I mean, my interest in human health actually dates back to the early 2000s when a lot of my peers in machine learning and I were using data sets that frankly were not very inspiring. Some of us old timers still remember the quote unquote 20 news groups data set where this was literally a bunch of texts from 20 news groups, a concept that doesn't really even exist anymore. And the question was, can you classify which news group a particular bag of words came from? And it wasn't very interesting. The data sets at the time on the biology side were much more interesting, both from a technical and also from an aspirational perspective. They were still pretty small, but they were better than 20 news groups. And so I started out, I think just by wanting to do something that was more, I don't know, societally useful and technically interesting. And then over time became more and more interested in the biology and the human health aspects for themselves and began to work even sometimes on papers that were just in biology without having a significant machine learning component. I think my interest in drug discovery is partly due to an incident I had with when my father sadly passed away about 12 years ago. He had an autoimmune disease that settled in his lungs and the doctors basically said, well, there's only one thing that we could do, which is give him prednisone. At some point, I remember a doctor even came and said, hey, let's do a lung biopsy to figure out which autoimmune disease he has. And I said, would that be helpful? Would that change treatment? He said, no, there's only prednisone. That's the only thing we can give him. And I had friends who were rheumatologists who said the FDA would never approve prednisone today because the ratio of side effects to benefit is probably not large enough. Today, we're in a state where there's probably four or five, maybe even more, well, it depends for which autoimmune disease, but there are multiple drugs that can help people with autoimmune disease, many of which didn't exist 12 years ago. And I think we're at a golden time in some ways in drug discovery where there's the ability to create drugs that are much more safe and much more effective than we've ever been able to before. And what's lacking is enough understanding of biology and mechanism to know where to aim that engine. And I think that's where machine learning can help. So in 2018, you started and now lead a company in Citro, which is, like you mentioned, perhaps the focus is drug discovery and the utilization of machine learning for drug discovery. So you mentioned that, quote, we're really interested in creating what you might call a disease in a dish model, disease in a dish models, places where diseases are complex, where we really haven't had a good model system, where typical animal models that have been used for years, including testing on mice, just aren't very effective. So can you try to describe what is an animal model and what is a disease in a dish model? Sure. So an animal model for disease is where you create effectively, it's what it sounds like. It's oftentimes a mouse where we have introduced some external perturbation that creates the disease and then we cure that disease. And the hope is that by doing that, we will cure a similar disease in the human. The problem is that oftentimes the way in which we generate the disease in the animal has nothing to do with how that disease actually comes about in a human. It's what you might think of as a copy of the phenotype, a copy of the clinical outcome, but the mechanisms are quite different. And so curing the disease in the animal, which in most cases doesn't happen naturally, mice don't get Alzheimer's, they don't get diabetes, they don't get atherosclerosis, they don't get autism or schizophrenia. Those cures don't translate over to what happens in the human. And that's where most drugs fails just because the findings that we had in the mouse don't translate to a human. The disease in the dish models is a fairly new approach. It's been enabled by technologies that have not existed for more than five to 10 years. So for instance, the ability for us to take a cell from any one of us, you or me, revert that say skin cell to what's called stem cell status, which is what's called the pluripotent cell that can then be differentiated into different types of cells. So from that pluripotent cell, one can create a Lex neuron or a Lex cardiomyocyte or a Lex hepatocyte that has your genetics, but that right cell type. And so if there's a genetic burden of disease that would manifest in that particular cell type, you might be able to see it by looking at those cells and saying, oh, that's what potentially sick cells look like versus healthy cells and then explore what kind of interventions might revert the unhealthy looking cell to a healthy cell. Now, of course, curing cells is not the same as curing people. And so there's still potentially a translatability gap, but at least for diseases that are driven, say by human genetics and where the human genetics is what drives the cellular phenotype, there is some reason to hope that if we revert those cells in which the disease begins and where the disease is driven by genetics and we can revert that cell back to a healthy state, maybe that will help also revert the more global clinical phenotype. and then talk about, well, what controls does one need when thinking about protections in the AI space? So, I think AGI obviously is a longstanding dream that even our early pioneers in the space had, the Turing test and so on are the earliest discussions of that. We're obviously closer than we were 70 or so years ago, but I think it's still very far away. I think machine learning algorithms today are really exquisitely good pattern recognizers in very specific problem domains where they have seen enough training data to make good predictions. You take a machine learning algorithm and you move it to a slightly different version of even that same problem, far less one that's different and it will just completely choke. So I think we're nowhere close to the versatility and flexibility of even a human toddler in terms of their ability to context switch and solve different problems using a single knowledge base, single brain. So am I desperately worried about the machines taking over the universe and starting to kill people because they want to have more power? I don't think so. Well, so to pause on that, so you kind of intuited that super intelligence is a very difficult thing to achieve. Even intelligence. Intelligence, intelligence. Super intelligence, we're not even close to intelligence. Even just the greater abilities of generalization of our current systems. But we haven't answered all the parts and we'll take another. I'm getting to the second part. Okay, but maybe another tangent you can also pick up is can we get in trouble with much dumber systems? Yes, and that is exactly where I was going. So just to wrap up on the threats of AGI, I think that it seems to me a little early today to figure out protections against a human level or superhuman level intelligence where we don't even see the skeleton of what that would look like. So it seems that it's very speculative on how to protect against that. But we can definitely and have gotten into trouble on much dumber systems. And a lot of that has to do with the fact that the systems that we're building are increasingly complex, increasingly poorly understood. And there's ripple effects that are unpredictable in changing little things that can have dramatic consequences on the outcome. And by the way, that's not unique to artificial intelligence. I think artificial intelligence exacerbates that, brings it to a new level. But heck, our electric grid is really complicated. The software that runs our financial markets is really complicated. And we've seen those ripple effects translate to dramatic negative consequences, like for instance, financial crashes that have to do with feedback loops that we didn't anticipate. So I think that's an issue that we need to be thoughtful about in many places, artificial intelligence being one of them. And I think it's really important that people are thinking about ways in which we can have better interpretability of systems, better tests for, for instance, measuring the extent to which a machine learning system that was trained in one set of circumstances, how well does it actually work in a very different set of circumstances where you might say, for instance, well, I'm not gonna be able to test my automated vehicle in every possible city, village, weather condition and so on. But if you trained it on this set of conditions and then tested it on 50 or a hundred others that were quite different from the ones that you trained it on and it worked, then that gives you confidence that the next 50 that you didn't test it on might also work. So effectively it's testing for generalizability. So I think there's ways that we should be constantly thinking about to validate the robustness of our systems. I think it's very different from the let's make sure robots don't take over the world. And then the other place where I think we have a threat, which is also important for us to think about is the extent to which technology can be abused. So like any really powerful technology, machine learning can be very much used badly as well as to good. And that goes back to many other technologies that have come up with when people invented projectile missiles and it turned into guns and people invented nuclear power and it turned into nuclear bombs. And I think honestly, I would say that to me, gene editing and CRISPR is at least as dangerous as technology if used badly than as machine learning. You could create really nasty viruses and such using gene editing that you would be really careful about. So anyway, that's something that we need to be really thoughtful about whenever we have any really powerful new technology. Yeah, and in the case of machine learning is adversarial machine learning. So all the kinds of attacks like security almost threats and there's a social engineering with machine learning algorithms. And there's face recognition and big brother is watching you and there's the killer drones that can potentially go and targeted execution of people in a different country. One can argue that bombs are not necessarily that much better, but people wanna kill someone, they'll find a way to do it. So in general, if you look at trends in the data, there's less wars, there's less violence, there's more human rights. So we've been doing overall quite good as a human species. Are you optimistic? Surprisingly sometimes. Are you optimistic? Maybe another way to ask is do you think most people are good and fundamentally we tend towards a better world, which is underlying the question, will machine learning with gene editing ultimately land us somewhere good? Are you optimistic? I think by and large, I'm optimistic. I think that most people mean well, that doesn't mean that most people are altruistic do gooders, but I think most people mean well, but I think it's also really important for us as a society to create social norms where doing good and being perceived well by our peers are positively correlated. I mean, it's very easy to create dysfunctional norms in emotional societies. There's certainly multiple psychological experiments as well as sadly real world events where people have devolved to a world where being perceived well by your peers is correlated with really atrocious, often genocidal behaviors. So we really want to make sure that we maintain a set of social norms where people know that to be a successful member of society, you want to be doing good. And one of the things that I sometimes worry about is that some societies don't seem to necessarily be moving in the forward direction in that regard where it's not necessarily the case that being a good person is what makes you be perceived well by your peers. And I think that's a really important thing for us as a society to remember. It's really easy to degenerate back into a universe where it's okay to do really bad stuff and still have your peers think you're amazing. It's fun to ask a world class computer scientist and engineer a ridiculously philosophical question like what is the meaning of life? Let me ask, what gives your life meaning? Or what is the source of fulfillment, happiness, joy, purpose? When we were starting Coursera in the fall of 2011, that was right around the time that Steve Jobs passed away. And so the media was full of various famous quotes that he uttered and one of them that really stuck with me because it resonated with stuff that I'd been feeling for even years before that is that our goal in life should be to make a dent in the universe. So I think that to me, what gives my life meaning is that I would hope that when I am lying there on my deathbed and looking at what I'd done in my life that I can point to ways in which I have left the world a better place than it was when I entered it. This is something I tell my kids all the time because I also think that the burden of that is much greater for those of us who were born to privilege. And in some ways I was, I mean, I wasn't born super wealthy or anything like that, but I grew up in an educated family with parents who loved me and took care of me and I had a chance at a great education and I always had enough to eat. So I was in many ways born to privilege more than the vast majority of humanity. And my kids I think are even more so born to privilege than I was fortunate enough to be. And I think it's really important that especially for those of us who have that opportunity that we use our lives to make the world a better place. I don't think there's a better way to end it.

And now let me leave you with some words from Hippocrates, a physician from ancient Greece who's considered to be the father of medicine. Wherever the art of medicine is loved, there's also a love of humanity. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time. So that's really what we're hoping to do. That step, that backward step, I was reading about it, the Yamanaka factor. Yes. So it's like that reverse step back to stem cells. Yes. Seems like magic. It is. Honestly, before that happened, I think very few people would have predicted that to be possible. It's amazing. Can you maybe elaborate, is it actually possible? Like where, like how stable? So this result was maybe like, I don't know how many years ago, maybe 10 years ago was first demonstrated, something like that. Is this, how hard is this? Like how noisy is this backward step? It seems quite incredible and cool. It is, it is incredible and cool. It was much more, I think finicky and bespoke at the early stages when the discovery was first made. But at this point, it's become almost industrialized. There are what's called contract research organizations, vendors that will take a sample from a human and revert it back to stem cell status. And it works a very good fraction of the time. Now there are people who will ask, I think good questions. Is this really truly a stem cell or does it remember certain aspects of what, of changes that were made in the human beyond the genetics? It's passed as a skin cell, yeah. It's passed as a skin cell or it's passed in terms of exposures to different environmental factors and so on. So I think the consensus right now is that these are not always perfect and there is little bits and pieces of memory sometimes, but by and large, these are actually pretty good. So one of the key things, well, maybe you can correct me, but one of the useful things for machine learning is size, scale of data. How easy it is to do these kinds of reversals to stem cells and then disease in a dish models at scale. Is that a huge challenge or not? So the reversal is not as of this point something that can be done at the scale of tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands. I think total number of stem cells or IPS cells that are what's called induced pluripotent stem cells in the world I think is somewhere between five and 10,000 last I looked. Now again, that might not count things that exist in this or that academic center and they may add up to a bit more, but that's about the range. So it's not something that you could at this point generate IPS cells from a million people, but maybe you don't need to because maybe that background is enough because it can also be now perturbed in different ways. And some people have done really interesting experiments in for instance, taking cells from a healthy human and then introducing a mutation into it using one of the other miracle technologies that's emerged in the last decade which is CRISPR gene editing and introduced a mutation that is known to be pathogenic. And so you can now look at the healthy cells and the unhealthy cells, the one with the mutation and do a one on one comparison where everything else is held constant. And so you could really start to understand specifically what the mutation does at the cellular level. So the IPS cells are a great starting point and obviously more diversity is better because you also wanna capture ethnic background and how that affects things, but maybe you don't need one from every single patient with every single type of disease because we have other tools at our disposal. Well, how much difference is there between people I mentioned ethnic background in terms of IPS cells? So we're all like, it seems like these magical cells that can do to create anything between different populations, different people. Is there a lot of variability between cell cells? Well, first of all, there's the variability, that's driven simply by the fact that genetically we're different. So a stem cell that's derived from my genotype is gonna be different from a stem cell that's derived from your genotype. There's also some differences that have more to do with for whatever reason, some people's stem cells differentiate better than other people's stem cells. We don't entirely understand why. So there's certainly some differences there as well, but the fundamental difference and the one that we really care about and is a positive is that the fact that the genetics are different and therefore recapitulate my disease burden versus your disease burden. What's a disease burden? Well, a disease burden is just if you think, I mean, it's not a well defined mathematical term, although there are mathematical formulations of it. If you think about the fact that some of us are more likely to get a certain disease than others because we have more variations in our genome that are causative of the disease, maybe fewer that are protective of the disease. People have quantified that using what are called polygenic risk scores, which look at all of the variations in an individual person's genome and add them all up in terms of how much risk they confer for a particular disease. And then they've put people on a spectrum of their disease risk. And for certain diseases where we've been sufficiently powered to really understand the connection between the many, many small variations that give rise to an increased disease risk, there's some pretty significant differences in terms of the risk between the people, say at the highest decile of this polygenic risk score and the people at the lowest decile. Sometimes those differences are factor of 10 or 12 higher. So there's definitely a lot that our genetics contributes to disease risk, even if it's not by any stretch the full explanation. And from a machine learning perspective, there's signal there. There is definitely signal in the genetics and there's even more signal, we believe, in looking at the cells that are derived from those different genetics because in principle, you could say all the signal is there at the genetics level. So we don't need to look at the cells, but our understanding of the biology is so limited at this point than seeing what actually happens at the cellular level is a heck of a lot closer to the human clinical outcome than looking at the genetics directly. And so we can learn a lot more from it than we could by looking at genetics alone. So just to get a sense, I don't know if it's easy to do, but what kind of data is useful in this disease in a dish model? Like what's the source of raw data information? And also from my outsider's perspective, so biology and cells are squishy things. And then how do you connect the computer to that? Which sensory mechanisms, I guess. So that's another one of those revolutions that have happened in the last 10 years in that our ability to measure cells very quantitatively has also dramatically increased. So back when I started doing biology in the late 90s, early 2000s, that was the initial era where we started to measure biology in really quantitative ways using things like microarrays, where you would measure in a single experiment the activity level, what's called expression level of every gene in the genome in that sample. And that ability is what actually allowed us to even understand that there are molecular subtypes of diseases like cancer, where up until that point, it's like, oh, you have breast cancer. But then when we looked at the molecular data, it was clear that there's different subtypes of breast cancer that at the level of gene activity look completely different to each other. So that was the beginning of this process. Now we have the ability to measure individual cells in terms of their gene activity using what's called single cell RNA sequencing, which basically sequences the RNA, which is that activity level of different genes for every gene in the genome. And you could do that at single cell level. So that's an incredibly powerful way of measuring cells. I mean, you literally count the number of transcripts. So it really turns that squishy thing into something that's digital. Another tremendous data source that's emerged in the last few years is microscopy and specifically even super resolution microscopy, where you could use digital reconstruction to look at subcellular structures, sometimes even things that are below the diffraction limit of light by doing a sophisticated reconstruction. And again, that gives you a tremendous amount of information at the subcellular level. There's now more and more ways that amazing scientists out there are developing for getting new types of information from even single cells. And so that is a way of turning those squishy things into digital data. Into beautiful data sets. But so that data set then with machine learning tools allows you to maybe understand the developmental, like the mechanism of a particular disease. And if it's possible to sort of at a high level describe, how does that help lead to a drug discovery that can help prevent, reverse that mechanism? So I think there's different ways in which this data could potentially be used. Some people use it for scientific discovery and say, oh, look, we see this phenotype at the cellular level. So let's try and work our way backwards and think which genes might be involved in pathways that give rise to that. So that's a very sort of analytical method to sort of work our way backwards using our understanding of known biology. Some people use it in a somewhat more, sort of forward, if that was a backward, this would be forward, which is to say, okay, if I can perturb this gene, does it show a phenotype that is similar to what I see in disease patients? And so maybe that gene is actually causal of the disease. So that's a different way. And then there's what we do, which is basically to take that very large collection of data and use machine learning to uncover the patterns that emerge from it. So for instance, what are those subtypes that might be similar at the human clinical outcome, but quite distinct when you look at the molecular data? And then if we can identify such a subtype, are there interventions that if I apply it to cells that come from this subtype of the disease and you apply that intervention, it could be a drug or it could be a CRISPR gene intervention, does it revert the disease state to something that looks more like normal, happy, healthy cells? And so hopefully if you see that, that gives you a certain hope that that intervention will also have a meaningful clinical benefit to people. And there's obviously a bunch of things that you would wanna do after that to validate that, but it's a very different and much less hypothesis driven way of uncovering new potential interventions and might give rise to things that are not the same things that everyone else is already looking at. That's, I don't know, I'm just like to psychoanalyze my own feeling about our discussion currently. It's so exciting to talk about sort of a machine, fundamentally, well, something that's been turned into a machine learning problem and that says can have so much real world impact. That's how I feel too. That's kind of exciting because I'm so, most of my day is spent with data sets that I guess closer to the news groups. So this is a kind of, it just feels good to talk about. In fact, I almost don't wanna talk about machine learning. I wanna talk about the fundamentals of the data set, which is an exciting place to be. I agree with you. It's what gets me up in the morning. It's also what attracts a lot of the people who work at InCetro to InCetro because I think all of the, certainly all of our machine learning people are outstanding and could go get a job selling ads online or doing eCommerce or even self driving cars. But I think they would want, they come to us because they want to work on something that has more of an aspirational nature and can really benefit humanity. What, with these approaches, what do you hope, what kind of diseases can be helped? We mentioned Alzheimer's, schizophrenia, type 2 diabetes. Can you just describe the various kinds of diseases that this approach can help? Well, we don't know. And I try and be very cautious about making promises about some things that, oh, we will cure X. People make that promise. And I think it's, I tried to first deliver and then promise as opposed to the other way around. There are characteristics of a disease that make it more likely that this type of approach can potentially be helpful. So for instance, diseases that have a very strong genetic basis are ones that are more likely to manifest in a stem cell derived model. We would want the cellular models to be relatively reproducible and robust so that you could actually get enough of those cells and in a way that isn't very highly variable and noisy. You would want the disease to be relatively contained in one or a small number of cell types that you could actually create in an in vitro, in a dish setting. Whereas if it's something that's really broad and systemic and involves multiple cells that are in very distal parts of your body, putting that all in the dish is really challenging. So we want to focus on the ones that are most likely to be successful today with the hope, I think, that really smart bioengineers out there are developing better and better systems all the time so that diseases that might not be tractable today might be tractable in three years. So for instance, five years ago, these stem cell derived models didn't really exist. People were doing most of the work in cancer cells and cancer cells are very, very poor models of most human biology because they're, A, they were cancer to begin with and B, as you passage them and they proliferate in a dish, they become, because of the genomic instability, even less similar to human biology. Now we have these stem cell derived models. We have the capability to reasonably robustly, not quite at the right scale yet, but close, to derive what's called organoids, which are these teeny little sort of multicellular organ, sort of models of an organ system. So there's cerebral organoids and liver organoids and kidney organoids and. Yeah, brain organoids. That's organoids. It's possibly the coolest thing I've ever seen. Is that not like the coolest thing? Yeah. And then I think on the horizon, we're starting to see things like connecting these organoids to each other so that you could actually start, and there's some really cool papers that start to do that where you can actually start to say, okay, can we do multi organ system stuff? There's many challenges to that. It's not easy by any stretch, but it might, I'm sure people will figure it out. And in three years or five years, there will be disease models that we could make for things that we can't make today. Yeah, and this conversation would seem almost outdated with the kind of scale that could be achieved in like three years. I hope so. That's the hope. That would be so cool. So you've cofounded Coursera with Andrew Ng and were part of the whole MOOC revolution. So to jump topics a little bit, can you maybe tell the origin story of the history, the origin story of MOOCs, of Coursera, and in general, your teaching to huge audiences on a very sort of impactful topic of AI in general? So I think the origin story of MOOCs emanates from a number of efforts that occurred at Stanford University around the late 2000s where different individuals within Stanford, myself included, were getting really excited about the opportunities of using online technologies as a way of achieving both improved quality of teaching and also improved scale. And so Andrew, for instance, led the Stanford Engineering Everywhere, which was sort of an attempt to take 10 Stanford courses and put them online just as video lectures. I led an effort within Stanford to take some of the courses and really create a very different teaching model that broke those up into smaller units and had some of those embedded interactions and so on, which got a lot of support from university leaders because they felt like it was potentially a way of improving the quality of instruction at Stanford by moving to what's now called the flipped classroom model. And so those efforts eventually sort of started to interplay with each other and created a tremendous sense of excitement and energy within the Stanford community about the potential of online teaching and led in the fall of 2011 to the launch of the first Stanford MOOCs. By the way, MOOCs, it's probably impossible that people don't know, but it's, I guess, massive. Open online courses. Open online courses. We did not come up with the acronym. I'm not particularly fond of the acronym, but it is what it is. It is what it is. Big bang is not a great term for the start of the universe, but it is what it is. Probably so. So anyway, so those courses launched in the fall of 2011, and there were, within a matter of weeks, with no real publicity campaign, just a New York Times article that went viral, about 100,000 students or more in each of those courses. And I remember this conversation that Andrew and I had. We were just like, wow, there's this real need here. And I think we both felt like, sure, we were accomplished academics and we could go back and go back to our labs, write more papers. But if we did that, then this wouldn't happen. And it seemed too important not to happen. And so we spent a fair bit of time debating, do we wanna do this as a Stanford effort, kind of building on what we'd started? Do we wanna do this as a for profit company? Do we wanna do this as a nonprofit? And we decided ultimately to do it as we did with Coursera. And so, you know, we started really operating as a company at the beginning of 2012. And the rest is history. But how did you, was that really surprising to you? How did you at that time and at this time make sense of this need for sort of global education you mentioned that you felt that, wow, the popularity indicates that there's a hunger for sort of globalization of learning. I think there is a hunger for learning that, you know, globalization is part of it, but I think it's just a hunger for learning. The world has changed in the last 50 years. It used to be that you finished college, you got a job, by and large, the skills that you learned in college were pretty much what got you through the rest of your job history. And yeah, you learn some stuff, but it wasn't a dramatic change. Today, we're in a world where the skills that you need for a lot of jobs, they didn't even exist when you went to college. And the jobs, and many of the jobs that existed when you went to college don't even exist today or are dying. So part of that is due to AI, but not only. And we need to find a way of keeping people, giving people access to the skills that they need today. And I think that's really what's driving a lot of this hunger. So I think if we even take a step back, for you, all of this started in trying to think of new ways to teach or to, new ways to sort of organize the material and present the material in a way that would help the education process, the pedagogy, yeah. So what have you learned about effective education from this process of playing, of experimenting with different ideas? So we learned a number of things. Some of which I think could translate back and have translated back effectively to how people teach on campus. And some of which I think are more specific to people who learn online, more sort of people who learn as part of their daily life. So we learned, for instance, very quickly that short is better. So people who are especially in the workforce can't do a 15 week semester long course. They just can't fit that into their lives. Sure, can you describe the shortness of what? The entirety, so every aspect, so the little lecture, the lecture's short, the course is short. Both. We started out, the first online education efforts were actually MIT's OpenCourseWare initiatives. And that was recording of classroom lectures and, Hour and a half or something like that, yeah. And that didn't really work very well. I mean, some people benefit. I mean, of course they did, but it's not really a very palatable experience for someone who has a job and three kids and they need to run errands and such. They can't fit 15 weeks into their life and the hour and a half is really hard. So we learned very quickly. I mean, we started out with short video modules and over time we made them shorter because we realized that 15 minutes was still too long. If you wanna fit in when you're waiting in line for your kid's doctor's appointment, it's better if it's five to seven. We learned that 15 week courses don't work and you really wanna break this up into shorter units so that there is a natural completion point, gives people a sense of they're really close to finishing something meaningful. They can always come back and take part two and part three. We also learned that compressing the content works really well because if some people that pace works well and for others, they can always rewind and watch again. And so people have the ability to then learn at their own pace. And so that flexibility, the brevity and the flexibility are both things that we found to be very important. We learned that engagement during the content is important and the quicker you give people feedback, the more likely they are to be engaged. Hence the introduction of these, which we actually was an intuition that I had going in and was then validated using data that introducing some of these sort of little micro quizzes into the lectures really helps. Self graded as automatically graded assessments really helped too because it gives people feedback. See, there you are. So all of these are valuable. And then we learned a bunch of other things too. We did some really interesting experiments, for instance, on gender bias and how having a female role model as an instructor can change the balance of men to women in terms of, especially in STEM courses. And you could do that online by doing AB testing in ways that would be really difficult to go on campus. Oh, that's exciting. But so the shortness, the compression, I mean, that's actually, so that probably is true for all good editing is always just compressing the content, making it shorter. So that puts a lot of burden on the creator of the, the instructor and the creator of the educational content. Probably most lectures at MIT or Stanford could be five times shorter if the preparation was put enough. So maybe people might disagree with that, but like the Christmas, the clarity that a lot of the, like Coursera delivers is, how much effort does that take? So first of all, let me say that it's not clear that that crispness would work as effectively in a face to face setting because people need time to absorb the material. And so you need to at least pause and give people a chance to reflect and maybe practice. And that's what MOOCs do is that they give you these chunks of content and then ask you to practice with it. And that's where I think some of the newer pedagogy that people are adopting in face to face teaching that have to do with interactive learning and such can be really helpful. But both those approaches, whether you're doing that type of methodology in online teaching or in that flipped classroom, interactive teaching. What's that, sorry to pause, what's flipped classroom? Flipped classroom is a way in which online content is used to supplement face to face teaching where people watch the videos perhaps and do some of the exercises before coming to class. And then when they come to class, it's actually to do much deeper problem solving oftentimes in a group. But any one of those different pedagogies that are beyond just standing there and droning on in front of the classroom for an hour and 15 minutes require a heck of a lot more preparation. And so it's one of the challenges I think that people have that we had when trying to convince instructors to teach on Coursera. And it's part of the challenges that pedagogy experts on campus have in trying to get faculty to teach differently is that it's actually harder to teach that way than it is to stand there and drone. Do you think MOOCs will replace in person education or become the majority of in person of education of the way people learn in the future? Again, the future could be very far away, but where's the trend going do you think? So I think it's a nuanced and complicated answer. I don't think MOOCs will replace face to face teaching. I think learning is in many cases a social experience. And even at Coursera, we had people who naturally formed study groups, even when they didn't have to, to just come and talk to each other. And we found that that actually benefited their learning in very important ways. So there was more success among learners who had those study groups than among ones who didn't. So I don't think it's just gonna, oh, we're all gonna just suddenly learn online with a computer and no one else in the same way that recorded music has not replaced live concerts. But I do think that especially when you are thinking about continuing education, the stuff that people get when they're traditional, whatever high school, college education is done, and they yet have to maintain their level of expertise and skills in a rapidly changing world, I think people will consume more and more educational content in this online format because going back to school for formal education is not an option for most people. Briefly, it might be a difficult question to ask, but there's a lot of people fascinated by artificial intelligence, by machine learning, by deep learning. Is there a recommendation for the next year or for a lifelong journey of somebody interested in this? How do they begin? How do they enter that learning journey? I think the important thing is first to just get started. And there's plenty of online content that one can get for both the core foundations of mathematics and statistics and programming. And then from there to machine learning, I would encourage people not to skip to quickly pass the foundations because I find that there's a lot of people who learn machine learning, whether it's online or on campus without getting those foundations. And they basically just turn the crank on existing models in ways that A, don't allow for a lot of innovation and an adjustment to the problem at hand, but also B, are sometimes just wrong and they don't even realize that their application is wrong because there's artifacts that they haven't fully understood. So I think the foundations, machine learning is an important step. And then actually start solving problems, try and find someone to solve them with because especially at the beginning, it's useful to have someone to bounce ideas off and fix mistakes that you make and you can fix mistakes that they make, but then just find practical problems, whether it's in your workplace or if you don't have that, Kaggle competitions or such are a really great place to find interesting problems and just practice. Practice. Perhaps a bit of a romanticized question, but what idea in deep learning do you find, have you found in your journey the most beautiful or surprising or interesting? Perhaps not just deep learning, but AI in general, statistics. I'm gonna answer with two things. One would be the foundational concept of end to end training, which is that you start from the raw data and you train something that is not like a single piece, but rather towards the actual goal that you're looking to. From the raw data to the outcome, like no details in between. Well, not no details, but the fact that you, I mean, you could certainly introduce building blocks that were trained towards other tasks. I'm actually coming to that in my second half of the answer, but it doesn't have to be like a single monolithic blob in the middle. Actually, I think that's not ideal, but rather the fact that at the end of the day, you can actually train something that goes all the way from the beginning to the end. And the other one that I find really compelling is the notion of learning a representation that in its turn, even if it was trained to another task, can potentially be used as a much more rapid starting point to solving a different task. And that's, I think, reminiscent of what makes people successful learners. It's something that is relatively new in the machine learning space. I think it's underutilized even relative to today's capabilities, but more and more of how do we learn sort of reusable representation? And so end to end and transfer learning. Yeah. Is it surprising to you that neural networks are able to, in many cases, do these things? Is it maybe taken back to when you first would dive deep into neural networks or in general, even today, is it surprising that neural networks work at all and work wonderfully to do this kind of raw end to end and end to end learning and even transfer learning? I think I was surprised by how well when you have large enough amounts of data, it's possible to find a meaningful representation in what is an exceedingly high dimensional space. And so I find that to be really exciting and people are still working on the math for that. There's more papers on that every year. And I think it would be really cool if we figured that out, but that to me was a surprise because in the early days when I was starting my way in machine learning and the data sets were rather small, I think we believed, I believed that you needed to have a much more constrained and knowledge rich search space to really make, to really get to a meaningful answer. And I think it was true at the time. What I think is still a question is will a completely knowledge free approach where there's no prior knowledge going into the construction of the model, is that gonna be the solution or not? It's not actually the solution today in the sense that the architecture of a convolutional neural network that's used for images is actually quite different to the type of network that's used for language and yet different from the one that's used for speech or biology or any other application. There's still some insight that goes into the structure of the network to get the right performance. Will you be able to come up with a universal learning machine? I don't know. I wonder if there's always has to be some insight injected somewhere or whether it can converge. So you've done a lot of interesting work with probabilistic graphical models in general, Bayesian deep learning and so on. Can you maybe speak high level, how can learning systems deal with uncertainty? One of the limitations I think of a lot of machine learning models is that they come up with an answer and you don't know how much you can believe that answer. And oftentimes the answer is actually quite poorly calibrated relative to its uncertainties. Even if you look at where the confidence that comes out of say the neural network at the end, and you ask how much more likely is an answer of 0.8 versus 0.9, it's not really in any way calibrated to the actual reliability of that network and how true it is. And the further away you move from the training data, the more, not only the more wrong the network is, often it's more wrong and more confident in its wrong answer. And that is a serious issue in a lot of application areas. So when you think for instance, about medical diagnosis as being maybe an epitome of how problematic this can be, if you were training your network on a certain set of patients and a certain patient population, and I have a patient that is an outlier and there's no human that looks at this, and that patient is put into a neural network and your network not only gives a completely incorrect diagnosis, but is supremely confident in its wrong answer, you could kill people. So I think creating more of an understanding of how do you produce networks that are calibrated in their uncertainty and can also say, you know what, I give up. I don't know what to say about this particular data instance because I've never seen something that's sufficiently like it before. I think it's going to be really important in mission critical applications, especially ones where human life is at stake and that includes medical applications, but it also includes automated driving because you'd want the network to be able to say, you know what, I have no idea what this blob is that I'm seeing in the middle of the road. So I'm just going to stop because I don't want to potentially run over a pedestrian that I don't recognize. Is there good mechanisms, ideas of how to allow learning systems to provide that uncertainty along with their predictions? Certainly people have come up with mechanisms that involve Bayesian deep learning, deep learning that involves Gaussian processes. I mean, there's a slew of different approaches that people have come up with. There's methods that use ensembles of networks trained with different subsets of data or different random starting points. Those are actually sometimes surprisingly good at creating a sort of set of how confident or not you are in your answer. It's very much an area of open research. Let's cautiously venture back into the land of philosophy and speaking of AI systems providing uncertainty, somebody like Stuart Russell believes that as we create more and more intelligence systems, it's really important for them to be full of self doubt because if they're given more and more power, we want the way to maintain human control over AI systems or human supervision, which is true. Like you just mentioned with autonomous vehicles, it's really important to get human supervision when the car is not sure because if it's really confident in cases when it can get in trouble, it's gonna be really problematic. So let me ask about sort of the questions of AGI and human level intelligence. I mean, we've talked about curing diseases, which is sort of fundamental thing we can have an impact today, but AI people also dream of both understanding and creating intelligence. Is that something you think about? Is that something you dream about? Is that something you think is within our reach to be thinking about as computer scientists? Well, boy, let me tease apart different parts of that question. The worst question. Yeah, it's a multi part question. So let me start with the feasibility of AGI. Then I'll talk about the timelines a little bit\n",

      "Text: The following is a conversation with Gary Marcus. He's a professor emeritus at NYU, founder of Robust AI and Geometric Intelligence. The latter is a machine learning company that was acquired by Uber in 2016. He's the author of several books, Unnatural and Artificial Intelligence, including his new book, Rebooting AI, Building Machines We Can Trust. Gary has been a critical voice, highlighting the limits of deep learning and AI in general and discussing the challenges before our AI community that must be solved in order to achieve artificial general intelligence. As I'm having these conversations, I try to find paths toward insight, towards new ideas. I try to have no ego in the process. It gets in the way. I'll often continuously try on several hats, several roles. One, for example, is the role of a three year old who understands very little about anything and asks big what and why questions. The other might be a role of a devil's advocate who presents counter ideas with the goal of arriving at greater understanding through debate. Hopefully, both are useful, interesting, and even entertaining at times. I ask for your patience as I learn to have better conversations. This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast. If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube, give it five stars on iTunes, support it on Patreon, or simply connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N. And now, here's my conversation with Gary Marcus. Do you think human civilization will one day have to face an AI driven technological singularity that will, in a societal way, modify our place in the food chain of intelligent living beings on this planet? I think our place in the food chain has already changed. So there are lots of things people used to do by hand that they do with machine. If you think of a singularity as like one single moment, which is, I guess, what it suggests, I don't know if it'll be like that, but I think that there's a lot of gradual change and AI is getting better and better. I mean, I'm here to tell you why I think it's not nearly as good as people think, but the overall trend is clear. Maybe Rick Hertzweil thinks it's an exponential and I think it's linear. In some cases, it's close to zero right now, but it's all gonna happen. I mean, we are gonna get to human level intelligence or whatever you want, artificial general intelligence at some point, and that's certainly gonna change our place in the food chain, because a lot of the tedious things that we do now, we're gonna have machines do, and a lot of the dangerous things that we do now, we're gonna have machines do. I think our whole lives are gonna change from people finding their meaning through their work through people finding their meaning through creative expression. So the singularity will be a very gradual, in fact, removing the meaning of the word singularity. It'll be a very gradual transformation in your view. I think that it'll be somewhere in between, and I guess it depends what you mean by gradual and sudden. I don't think it's gonna be one day. I think it's important to realize that intelligence is a multidimensional variable. So people sort of write this stuff as if IQ was one number, and the day that you hit 262 or whatever, you displace the human beings. And really, there's lots of facets to intelligence. So there's verbal intelligence, and there's motor intelligence, and there's mathematical intelligence and so forth. Machines, in their mathematical intelligence, far exceed most people already. In their ability to play games, they far exceed most people already. In their ability to understand language, they lag behind my five year old, far behind my five year old. So there are some facets of intelligence that machines have grasped, and some that they haven't, and we have a lot of work left to do to get them to, say, understand natural language, or to understand how to flexibly approach some kind of novel MacGyver problem solving kind of situation. And I don't know that all of these things will come at once. I think there are certain vital prerequisites that we're missing now. So for example, machines don't really have common sense now. So they don't understand that bottles contain water, and that people drink water to quench their thirst, and that they don't wanna dehydrate. They don't know these basic facts about human beings, and I think that that's a rate limiting step for many things. It's a great limiting step for reading, for example, because stories depend on things like, oh my God, that person's running out of water. That's why they did this thing. Or if they only had water, they could put out the fire. So you watch a movie, and your knowledge about how things work matter. And so a computer can't understand that movie if it doesn't have that background knowledge. Same thing if you read a book. And so there are lots of places where, if we had a good machine interpretable set of common sense, many things would accelerate relatively quickly, but I don't think even that is a single point. There's many different aspects of knowledge. And we might, for example, find that we make a lot of progress on physical reasoning, getting machines to understand, for example, how keys fit into locks, or that kind of stuff, or how this gadget here works, and so forth and so on. And so machines might do that long before they do really good psychological reasoning, because it's easier to get kind of labeled data or to do direct experimentation on a microphone stand than it is to do direct experimentation on human beings to understand the levers that guide them. That's a really interesting point, actually, whether it's easier to gain common sense knowledge or psychological knowledge. I would say the common sense knowledge includes both physical knowledge and psychological knowledge. And the argument I was making. Well, you said physical versus psychological. Yeah, physical versus psychological. And the argument I was making is physical knowledge might be more accessible, because you could have a robot, for example, lift a bottle, try putting a bottle cap on it, see that it falls off if it does this, and see that it could turn it upside down, and so the robot could do some experimentation. We do some of our psychological reasoning by looking at our own minds. So I can sort of guess how you might react to something based on how I think I would react to it. And robots don't have that intuition, and they also can't do experiments on people in the same way or we'll probably shut them down. So if we wanted to have robots figure out how I respond to pain by pinching me in different ways, like that's probably, it's not gonna make it past the human subjects board and companies are gonna get sued or whatever. So there's certain kinds of practical experience that are limited or off limits to robots. That's a really interesting point. What is more difficult to gain a grounding in? Because to play devil's advocate, I would say that human behavior is easier expressed in data and digital form. And so when you look at Facebook algorithms, they get to observe human behavior. So you get to study and manipulate even a human behavior in a way that you perhaps cannot study or manipulate the physical world. So it's true why you said pain is like physical pain, but that's again, the physical world. Emotional pain might be much easier to experiment with, perhaps unethical, but nevertheless, some would argue it's already going on. I think that you're right, for example, that Facebook does a lot of experimentation in psychological reasoning. In fact, Zuckerberg talked about AI at a talk that he gave in NIPS. I wasn't there, but the conference has been renamed NeurIPS, but he used to be called NIPS when he gave the talk. And he talked about Facebook basically having a gigantic theory of mind. So I think it is certainly possible. I mean, Facebook does some of that. I think they have a really good idea of how to addict people to things. They understand what draws people back to things. I think they exploit it in ways that I'm not very comfortable with. But even so, I think that there are only some slices of human experience that they can access through the kind of interface they have. And of course, they're doing all kinds of VR stuff, and maybe that'll change and they'll expand their data. And I'm sure that that's part of their goal. So it is an interesting question. I think love, fear, insecurity, all of the things that, I would say some of the deepest things about human nature and the human mind could be explored through digital form. It's that you're actually the first person just now that brought up, I wonder what is more difficult. Because I think folks who are the slow, and we'll talk a lot about deep learning, but the people who are thinking beyond deep learning are thinking about the physical world. You're starting to think about robotics in the home robotics. How do we make robots manipulate objects, which requires an understanding of the physical world and then requires common sense reasoning. And that has felt to be like the next step for common sense reasoning, but you've now brought up the idea that there's also the emotional part. And it's interesting whether that's hard or easy. I think some parts of it are and some aren't. So my company that I recently founded with Rod Brooks, from MIT for many years and so forth, we're interested in both. We're interested in physical reasoning and psychological reasoning, among many other things. And there are pieces of each of these that are accessible. So if you want a robot to figure out whether it can fit under a table, that's a relatively accessible piece of physical reasoning. If you know the height of the table and you know the height of the robot, it's not that hard. If you wanted to do physical reasoning about Jenga, it gets a little bit more complicated and you have to have higher resolution data in order to do it. With psychological reasoning, it's not that hard to know, for example, that people have goals and they like to act on those goals, but it's really hard to know exactly what those goals are. But ideas of frustration. I mean, you could argue it's extremely difficult to understand the sources of human frustration as they're playing Jenga with you, or not. You could argue that it's very accessible. There's some things that are gonna be obvious and some not. So I don't think anybody really can do this well yet, but I think it's not inconceivable to imagine machines in the not so distant future being able to understand that if people lose in a game, that they don't like that. That's not such a hard thing to program and it's pretty consistent across people. Most people don't enjoy losing and so that makes it relatively easy to code. On the other hand, if you wanted to capture everything about frustration, well, people can get frustrated for a lot of different reasons. They might get sexually frustrated, they might get frustrated, they can get their promotion at work, all kinds of different things. And the more you expand the scope, the harder it is for anything like the existing techniques to really do that. So I'm talking to Garret Kasparov next week and he seemed pretty frustrated with his game against Deep Blue, so. Yeah, well, I'm frustrated with my game against him last year, because I played him, I had two excuses, I'll give you my excuses up front, but it won't mitigate the outcome. I was jet lagged and I hadn't played in 25 or 30 years, but the outcome is he completely destroyed me and it wasn't even close. Have you ever been beaten in any board game by a machine? I have, I actually played the predecessor to Deep Blue. Deep Thought, I believe it was called, and that too crushed me. And that was, and after that you realize it's over for us. Well, there's no point in my playing Deep Blue. I mean, it's a waste of Deep Blue's computation. I mean, I played Kasparov because we both gave lectures this same event and he was playing 30 people. I forgot to mention that. Not only did he crush me, but he crushed 29 other people at the same time. I mean, but the actual philosophical and emotional experience of being beaten by a machine, I imagine is a, I mean, to you who thinks about these things may be a profound experience. Or no, it was a simple mathematical experience. Yeah, I think a game like chess particularly where you have perfect information, it's two player closed end and there's more computation for the computer, it's no surprise the machine wins. I mean, I'm not sad when a computer, I'm not sad when a computer calculates a cube root faster than me. Like, I know I can't win that game. I'm not gonna try. Well, with a system like AlphaGo or AlphaZero, do you see a little bit more magic in a system like that even though it's simply playing a board game? But because there's a strong learning component? You know, I find you should mention that in the context of this conversation because Kasparov and I are working on an article that's gonna be called AI is not magic. And, you know, neither one of us thinks that it's magic. And part of the point of this article is that AI is actually a grab bag of different techniques and some of them have, or they each have their own unique strengths and weaknesses. So, you know, you read media accounts and it's like, ooh, AI, it must be magical or it can solve any problem. Well, no, some problems are really accessible like chess and go and other problems like reading are completely outside the current technology. And it's not like you can take the technology, that drives AlphaGo and apply it to reading and get anywhere. You know, DeepMind has tried that a bit. They have all kinds of resources. You know, they built AlphaGo and they have, you know, I wrote a piece recently that they lost and you can argue about the word lost, but they spent $530 million more than they made last year. So, you know, they're making huge investments. They have a large budget and they have applied the same kinds of techniques to reading or to language. It's just much less productive there because it's a fundamentally different kind of problem. Chess and go and so forth are closed end problems. The rules haven't changed in 2,500 years. There's only so many moves you can make. You can talk about the exponential as you look at the combinations of moves, but fundamentally, you know, the go board has 361 squares. That's it. That's the only, you know, those intersections are the only places that you can place your stone. Whereas when you're reading, the next sentence could be anything. You know, it's completely up to the writer what they're gonna do next. That's fascinating that you think this way. You're clearly a brilliant mind who points out the emperor has no clothes, but so I'll play the role of a person who says. You're gonna put clothes on the emperor? Good luck with it. It romanticizes the notion of the emperor, period, suggesting that clothes don't even matter. Okay, so that's really interesting that you're talking about language. So there's the physical world of being able to move about the world, making an omelet and coffee and so on. There's language where you first understand what's being written and then maybe even more complicated than that, having a natural dialogue. And then there's the game of go and chess. I would argue that language is much closer to go than it is to the physical world. Like it is still very constrained. When you say the possibility of the number of sentences that could come, it is huge, but it nevertheless is much more constrained. It feels maybe I'm wrong than the possibilities that the physical world brings us. There's something to what you say in some ways in which I disagree. So one interesting thing about language is that it abstracts away. This bottle, I don't know if it would be in the field of view is on this table and I use the word on here and I can use the word on here, maybe not here, but that one word encompasses in analog space sort of infinite number of possibilities. So there is a way in which language filters down the variation of the world and there's other ways. So we have a grammar and more or less you have to follow the rules of that grammar. You can break them a little bit, but by and large we follow the rules of grammar and so that's a constraint on language. So there are ways in which language is a constrained system. On the other hand, there are many arguments that say there's an infinite number of possible sentences and you can establish that by just stacking them up. So I think there's water on the table, you think that I think there's water on the table, your mother thinks that you think that I think that water's on the table, your brother thinks that maybe your mom is wrong to think that you think that I think, right? So we can make sentences of infinite length or we can stack up adjectives. This is a very silly example, a very, very silly example, a very, very, very, very, very, very silly example and so forth. So there are good arguments that there's an infinite range of sentences. In any case, it's vast by any reasonable measure and for example, almost anything in the physical world we can talk about in the language world and interestingly, many of the sentences that we understand, we can only understand if we have a very rich model of the physical world. So I don't ultimately want to adjudicate the debate that I think you just set up, but I find it interesting. Maybe the physical world is even more complicated than language, I think that's fair, but. Language is really, really complicated. It's really, really hard. Well, it's really, really hard for machines, for linguists, people trying to understand it. It's not that hard for children and that's part of what's driven my whole career. I was a student of Steven Pinker's and we were trying to figure out why kids could learn language when machines couldn't. I think we're gonna get into language, we're gonna get into communication intelligence and neural networks and so on, but let me return to the high level, the futuristic for a brief moment. So you've written in your book, in your new book, it would be arrogant to suppose that we could forecast where AI will be or the impact it will have in a thousand years or even 500 years. So let me ask you to be arrogant. What do AI systems with or without physical bodies look like 100 years from now? If you would just, you can't predict, but if you were to philosophize and imagine, do. Can I first justify the arrogance before you try to push me beyond it? Sure. I mean, there are examples like, people figured out how electricity worked, they had no idea that that was gonna lead to cell phones. I mean, things can move awfully fast once new technologies are perfected. Even when they made transistors, they weren't really thinking that cell phones would lead to social networking. There are nevertheless predictions of the future, which are statistically unlikely to come to be, but nevertheless is the best. You're asking me to be wrong. Asking you to be statistically. In which way would I like to be wrong? Pick the least unlikely to be wrong thing, even though it's most very likely to be wrong. I mean, here's some things that we can safely predict, I suppose. We can predict that AI will be faster than it is now. It will be cheaper than it is now. It will be better in the sense of being more general and applicable in more places. It will be pervasive. I mean, these are easy predictions. I'm sort of modeling them in my head on Jeff Bezos's famous predictions. He says, I can't predict the future, not in every way, I'm paraphrasing. But I can predict that people will never wanna pay more money for their stuff. They're never gonna want it to take longer to get there. So you can't predict everything, but you can predict something. Sure, of course it's gonna be faster and better. But what we can't really predict is the full scope of where AI will be in a certain period. I mean, I think it's safe to say that, although I'm very skeptical about current AI, that it's possible to do much better. You know, there's no in principled argument that says AI is an insolvable problem, that there's magic inside our brains that will never be captured. I mean, I've heard people make those kind of arguments. I don't think they're very good. So AI's gonna come, and probably 500 years is plenty to get there. And then once it's here, it really will change everything. So when you say AI's gonna come, But I would say that it's a pretty interesting set of things that we are equipped with that allows us to do a lot of interesting things. So I would argue or guess, based on my reading of the developmental psychology literature, which I've also participated in, that children are born with a notion of space, time, other agents, places, and also this kind of mental algebra that I was describing before. No certain causation if I didn't just say that. So at least those kinds of things. They're like frameworks for learning the other things. Are they disjoint in your view or is it just somehow all connected? You've talked a lot about language. Is it all kind of connected in some mesh that's language like? If understanding concepts all together or? I don't think we know for people how they're represented and machines just don't really do this yet. So I think it's an interesting open question both for science and for engineering. Some of it has to be at least interrelated in the way that the interfaces of a software package have to be able to talk to one another. So the systems that represent space and time can't be totally disjoint because a lot of the things that we reason about are the relations between space and time and cause. So I put this on and I have expectations about what's gonna happen with the bottle cap on top of the bottle and those span space and time. If the cap is over here, I get a different outcome. If the timing is different, if I put this here, after I move that, then I get a different outcome. That relates to causality. So obviously these mechanisms, whatever they are, can certainly communicate with each other. So I think evolution had a significant role to play in the development of this whole kluge, right? How efficient do you think is evolution? Oh, it's terribly inefficient except that. Okay, well, can we do better? Well, I'll come to that in a sec. It's inefficient except that. Once it gets a good idea, it runs with it. So it took, I guess, a billion years, if I went roughly a billion years, to evolve to a vertebrate brain plan. And once that vertebrate brain plan evolved, it spread everywhere. So fish have it and dogs have it and we have it. We have adaptations of it and specializations of it, but, and the same thing with a primate brain plan. So monkeys have it and apes have it and we have it. So there are additional innovations like color vision and those spread really rapidly. So it takes evolution a long time to get a good idea, but, and I'm being anthropomorphic and not literal here, but once it has that idea, so to speak, which cashes out into one set of genes or in the genome, those genes spread very rapidly and they're like subroutines or libraries, I guess the word people might use nowadays or be more familiar with. They're libraries that get used over and over again. So once you have the library for building something with multiple digits, you can use it for a hand, but you can also use it for a foot. You just kind of reuse the library with slightly different parameters. Evolution does a lot of that, which means that the speed over time picks up. So evolution can happen faster because you have bigger and bigger libraries. And what I think has happened in attempts at evolutionary computation is that people start with libraries that are very, very minimal, like almost nothing, and then progress is slow and it's hard for someone to get a good PhD thesis out of it and they give up. If we had richer libraries to begin with, if you were evolving from systems that had an rich innate structure to begin with, then things might speed up. Or more PhD students, if the evolutionary process is indeed in a meta way runs away with good ideas, you need to have a lot of ideas, pool of ideas in order for it to discover one that you can run away with. And PhD students representing individual ideas as well. Yeah, I mean, you could throw a billion PhD students at it. Yeah, the monkeys are typewriters with Shakespeare, yep. Well, I mean, those aren't cumulative, right? That's just random. And part of the point that I'm making is that evolution is cumulative. So if you have a billion monkeys independently, you don't really get anywhere. But if you have a billion monkeys, and I think Dawkins made this point originally, or probably other people, Dawkins made it very nice and either a selfish gene or blind watchmaker. If there is some sort of fitness function that can drive you towards something, I guess that's Dawkins point. And my point, which is a variation on that, is that if the evolution is cumulative, I mean, the related points, then you can start going faster. Do you think something like the process of evolution is required to build intelligent systems? So if we... Not logically. So all the stuff that evolution did, a good engineer might be able to do. So for example, evolution made quadrupeds, which distribute the load across a horizontal surface. A good engineer could come up with that idea. I mean, sometimes good engineers come up with ideas by looking at biology. There's lots of ways to get your ideas. Part of what I'm suggesting is we should look at biology a lot more. We should look at the biology of thought and understanding and the biology by which creatures intuitively reason about physics or other agents, or like how do dogs reason about people? Like they're actually pretty good at it. If we could understand, at my college we joked dognition, if we could understand dognition well, and how it was implemented, that might help us with our AI. So do you think it's possible that the kind of timescale that evolution took is the kind of timescale that will be needed to build intelligent systems? Or can we significantly accelerate that process inside a computer? I mean, I think the way that we accelerate that process is we borrow from biology, not slavishly, but I think we look at how biology has solved problems and we say, does that inspire any engineering solutions here? Try to mimic biological systems and then therefore have a shortcut. Yeah, I mean, there's a field called biomimicry and people do that for like material science all the time. We should be doing the analog of that for AI and the analog for that for AI is to look at cognitive science or the cognitive sciences, which is psychology, maybe neuroscience, linguistics, and so forth, look to those for insight. What do you think is a good test of intelligence in your view? So I don't think there's one good test. In fact, I tried to organize a movement towards something called a Turing Olympics and my hope is that Francois is actually gonna take, Francois Chollet is gonna take over this. I think he's interested and I don't, I just don't have place in my busy life at this moment, but the notion is that there'd be many tests and not just one because intelligence is multifaceted. There can't really be a single measure of it because it isn't a single thing. Like just the crudest level, the SAT has a verbal component and a math component because they're not identical. And Howard Gardner has talked about multiple intelligences like kinesthetic intelligence and verbal intelligence and so forth. There are a lot of things that go into intelligence and people can get good at one or the other. I mean, in some sense, like every expert has developed a very specific kind of intelligence and then there are people that are generalists and I think of myself as a generalist with respect to cognitive science, which doesn't mean I know anything about quantum mechanics, but I know a lot about the different facets of the mind. And there's a kind of intelligence to thinking about intelligence. I like to think that I have some of that, but social intelligence, I'm just okay. There are people that are much better at that than I am. Sure, but what would be really impressive to you? I think the idea of a touring Olympics is really interesting especially if somebody like Francois is running it, but to you in general, not as a benchmark, but if you saw an AI system being able to accomplish something that would impress the heck out of you, what would that thing be? Would it be natural language conversation? For me personally, I would like to see a kind of comprehension that relates to what you just said. So I wrote a piece in the New Yorker in I think 2015 right after Eugene Guestman, which was a software package, won a version of the Turing test. And the way that it did this is it be, well, the way you win the Turing test, so called win it, is the Turing test is you fool a person into thinking that a machine is a person, is you're evasive, you pretend to have limitations so you don't have to answer certain questions and so forth. So this particular system pretended to be a 13 year old boy from Odessa who didn't understand English and was kind of sarcastic and wouldn't answer your questions and so forth. And so judges got fooled into thinking briefly with a very little exposure, it was a 13 year old boy, and it docked all the questions Turing was actually interested in, which is like how do you make the machine actually intelligent? So that test itself is not that good. And so in New Yorker, I proposed an alternative, I guess, and the one that I proposed there was a comprehension test. And I must like Breaking Bad because I've already given you one Breaking Bad example and in that article, I have one as well, which was something like if Walter, you should be able to watch an episode of Breaking Bad or maybe you have to watch the whole series to be able to answer the question and say, if Walter White took a hit out on Jesse, why did he do that? So if you could answer kind of arbitrary questions about characters motivations, I would be really impressed with that and he built software to do that. They could watch a film or there are different versions. And so ultimately, I wrote this up with Praveen Paritosh in a special issue of AI Magazine that basically was about the Turing Olympics. There were like 14 tests proposed. The one that I was pushing was a comprehension challenge and Praveen who's at Google was trying to figure out like how we would actually run it and so we wrote a paper together. And you could have a text version too or you could have an auditory podcast version, you could have a written version. But the point is that you win at this test if you can do, let's say human level or better than humans at answering kind of arbitrary questions. Why did this person pick up the stone? What were they thinking when they picked up the stone? Were they trying to knock down glass? And I mean, ideally these wouldn't be multiple choice either because multiple choice is pretty easily gamed. So if you could have relatively open ended questions and you can answer why people are doing this stuff, I would be very impressed. And of course, humans can do this, right? If you watch a well constructed movie and somebody picks up a rock, everybody watching the movie knows why they picked up the rock, right? They all know, oh my gosh, he's gonna hit this character or whatever. We have an example in the book about when a whole bunch of people say, I am Spartacus, you know, this famous scene. The viewers understand, first of all, that everybody or everybody minus one has to be lying. They can't all be Spartacus. We have enough common sense knowledge to know they couldn't all have the same name. We know that they're lying and we can infer why they're lying, right? They're lying to protect someone and to protect things they believe in. You get a machine that can do that. They can say, this is why these guys all got up and said, I am Spartacus. I will sit down and say, AI has really achieved a lot. Thank you. Without cheating any part of the system. Yeah, I mean, if you do it, there are lots of ways you could cheat. You could build a Spartacus machine that works on that film. That's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about, you can do this with essentially arbitrary films or from a large set. Even beyond films because it's possible such a system would discover that the number of narrative arcs in film is limited to 1930. Well, there's a famous thing about the classic seven plots or whatever. I don't care. If you wanna build in the system, boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy finds girl. That's fine. I don't mind having some head stories on it. And they acknowledge. Okay, good. I mean, you could build it in innately or you could have your system watch a lot of films again. If you can do this at all, but with a wide range of films, not just one film in one genre. But even if you could do it for all Westerns, I'd be reasonably impressed. Yeah. So in terms of being impressed, just for the fun of it, because you've put so many interesting ideas out there in your book, challenging the community for further steps. Is it possible on the deep learning front that you're wrong about its limitations? That deep learning will unlock, Yann LeCun next year will publish a paper that achieves this comprehension. So do you think that way often as a scientist? Do you consider that your intuition that deep learning could actually run away with it? I'm more worried about rebranding as a kind of political thing. So, I mean, what's gonna happen, I think, is the deep learning is gonna start to encompass symbol manipulation. So I think Hinton's just wrong. Hinton says we don't want hybrids. I think people will work towards hybrids and they will relabel their hybrids as deep learning. We've already seen some of that. So AlphaGo is often described as a deep learning system, but it's more correctly described as a system that has deep learning, but also Monte Carlo tree search, which is a classical AI technique. And people will start to blur the lines in the way that IBM blurred Watson. First, Watson meant this particular system, and then it was just anything that IBM built in their cognitive division. But purely, let me ask, for sure, that's a branding question and that's like a giant mess. I mean, purely, a single neural network being able to accomplish reasonable comprehension. I don't stay up at night worrying that that's gonna happen. And I'll just give you two examples. One is a guy at DeepMind thought he had finally outfoxed me. At Zergilord, I think is his Twitter handle. And he said, he specifically made an example. Marcus said that such and such. He fed it into GP2, which is the AI system that is so smart that OpenAI couldn't release it because it would destroy the world, right? You remember that a few months ago. So he feeds it into GPT2, and my example was something like a rose is a rose, a tulip is a tulip, a lily is a blank. And he got it to actually do that, which was a little bit impressive. And I wrote back and I said, that's impressive, but can I ask you a few questions? I said, was that just one example? Can it do it generally? And can it do it with novel words, which was part of what I was talking about in 1998 when I first raised the example. So a dax is a dax, right? And he sheepishly wrote back about 20 minutes later. And the answer was, well, it had some problems with those. So I made some predictions 21 years ago that still hold. In the world of computer science, that's amazing, right? Because there's a thousand or a million times more memory and computations a million times, do million times more operations per second spread across a cluster. And there's been advances in replacing sigmoids with other functions and so forth. There's all kinds of advances, but the fundamental architecture hasn't changed and the fundamental limit hasn't changed. And what I said then is kind of still true. Then here's a second example. I recently had a piece in Wired that's adapted from the book. And the book went to press before GP2 came out, but we described this children's story and all the inferences that you make in this story about a boy finding a lost wallet. And for fun, in the Wired piece, we ran it through GP2. GPT2, something called talktotransformer.com, and your viewers can try this experiment themselves. Go to the Wired piece that has the link and it has the story. And the system made perfectly fluent text that was totally inconsistent with the conceptual underpinnings of the story, right? This is what, again, I predicted in 1998. And for that matter, Chomsky and Miller made the same prediction in 1963. I was just updating their claim for a slightly new text. So those particular architectures that don't have any built in knowledge, they're basically just a bunch of layers doing correlational stuff. They're not gonna solve these problems. So 20 years ago, you said the emperor has no clothes. Today, the emperor still has no clothes. The lighting's better though. The lighting is better. And I think you yourself are also, I mean. And we found out some things to do with naked emperors. I mean, it's not like stuff is worthless. I mean, they're not really naked. It's more like they're in their briefs than everybody thinks they are. And so like, I mean, they are great at speech recognition, but the problems that I said were hard. I didn't literally say the emperor has no clothes. I said, this is a set of problems that humans are really good at. And it wasn't couched as AI. It was couched as cognitive science. But I said, if you wanna build a neural model of how humans do certain class of things, you're gonna have to change the architecture. And I stand by those claims. So, and I think people should understand you're quite entertaining in your cynicism, but you're also very optimistic and a dreamer about the future of AI too. So you're both, it's just. There's a famous saying about being, people overselling technology in the short run and underselling it in the long run. And so I actually end the book, Ernie Davis and I end our book with an optimistic chapter, which kind of killed Ernie because he's even more pessimistic than I am. He describes me as a contrarian and him as a pessimist. But I persuaded him that we should end the book with a look at what would happen if AI really did incorporate, for example, the common sense reasoning and the nativism and so forth, the things that we counseled for. And we wrote it and it's an optimistic chapter that AI suitably reconstructed so that we could trust it, which we can't now, could really be world changing. So on that point, if you look at the future trajectories of AI, people have worries about negative effects of AI, whether it's at the large existential scale or smaller short term scale of negative impact on society. So you write about trustworthy AI, how can we build AI systems that align with our values, that make for a better world, that we can interact with, that we can trust? The first thing we have to do is to replace deep learning with deep understanding. So you can't have alignment with a system that traffics only in correlations and doesn't understand concepts like bottles or harm. So Asimov talked about these famous laws and the first one was first do no harm. And you can quibble about the details of Asimov's laws, but we have to, if we're gonna build real robots in the real world, have something like that. That means we have to program in a notion that's at least something like harm. That means we have to have these more abstract ideas that deep learning is not particularly good at. They have to be in the mix somewhere. And you could do statistical analysis about probabilities of given harms or whatever, but you have to know what a harm is in the same way that you have to understand that a bottle isn't just a collection of pixels. And also be able to, you're implying that you need to also be able to communicate that to humans so the AI systems would be able to prove to humans that they understand that they know what harm means. I might run it in the reverse direction, but roughly speaking, I agree with you. So we probably need to have committees of wise people, ethicists and so forth. Think about what these rules ought to be and we shouldn't just leave it to software engineers. It shouldn't just be software engineers and it shouldn't just be people who own large mega corporations that are good at technology, ethicists and so forth should be involved. But there should be some assembly of wise people as I was putting it that tries to figure out what the rules ought to be. And those have to get translated into code. You can argue or code or neural networks or something. They have to be translated into something that machines can work with. And that means there has to be a way of working the translation. And right now we don't. We don't have a way. So let's say you and I were the committee and we decide that Asimov's first law is actually right. And let's say it's not just two white guys, which would be kind of unfortunate that we have abroad. And so we've representative sample of the world or however we wanna do this. And the committee decides eventually, okay, Asimov's first law is actually pretty good. There are these exceptions to it. We wanna program in these exceptions. But let's start with just the first one and then we'll get to the exceptions. First one is first do no harm. Well, somebody has to now actually turn that into a computer program or a neural network or something. And one way of taking the whole book, the whole argument that I'm making is that we just don't have to do that yet. And we're fooling ourselves if we think that we can build trustworthy AI if we can't even specify in any kind of, we can't do it in Python and we can't do it in TensorFlow. We're fooling ourselves in thinking that we can make trustworthy AI if we can't translate harm into something that we can execute. And if we can't, then we should be thinking really hard how could we ever do such a thing? Because if we're gonna use AI in the ways that we wanna use it, to make job interviews or to do surveillance, not that I personally wanna do that or whatever. I mean, if we're gonna use AI in ways that have practical impact on people's lives or medicine, it's gotta be able to understand stuff like that. So one of the things your book highlights is that a lot of people in the deep learning community, but also the general public, politicians, just people in all general groups and walks of life have different levels of misunderstanding of AI. So when you talk about committees, what's your advice to our society? How do we grow, how do we learn about AI such that such committees could emerge where large groups of people could have a productive discourse about how to build successful AI systems? Part of the reason we wrote the book was to try to inform those committees. So part of the reason we wrote the book was to inspire a future generation of students to solve what we think are the important problems. So a lot of the book is trying to pinpoint what we think are the hard problems where we think effort would most be rewarded. And part of it is to try to train people who talk about AI, but aren't experts in the field to understand what's realistic and what's not. One of my favorite parts in the book is the six questions you should ask anytime you read a media account. So like number one is if somebody talks about something, look for the demo. If there's no demo, don't believe it. Like the demo that you can try. If you can't try it at home, maybe it doesn't really work that well yet. So if, we don't have this example in the book, but if Sundar Pinchai says we have this thing that allows it to sound like human beings in conversation, you should ask, can I try it? And you should ask how general it is. And it turns out at that time, I'm alluding to Google Duplex when it was announced, it only worked on calling hairdressers, restaurants and finding opening hours. That's not very general, that's narrow AI. And I'm not gonna ask your thoughts about Sophia, but yeah, I understand that's a really good question to ask of any kind of hype top idea. Sophia has very good material written for her, but she doesn't understand the things that she's saying. So a while ago you've written a book on the science of learning, which I think is fascinating, but the learning case studies of playing guitar. That's called Guitar Zero. I love guitar myself, I've been playing my whole life. So let me ask a very important question. What is your favorite song, rock song, to listen to or try to play? Well, those would be different, but I'll say that my favorite rock song to listen to is probably All Along the Watchtower, the Jimi Hendrix version. The Jimi Hendrix version. It feels magic to me. I've actually recently learned it, I love that song. I've been trying to put it on YouTube, myself singing. Singing is the scary part. If you could party with a rock star for a weekend, living or dead, who would you choose? And pick their mind, it's not necessarily about the partying. Thanks for the clarification. I guess John Lennon's such an intriguing person, and I think a troubled person, but an intriguing one. Beautiful. Well, Imagine is one of my favorite songs. Also one of my favorite songs. That's a beautiful way to end it. Gary, thank you so much for talking to me. Thanks so much for having me. are you talking about human level intelligence? So maybe I... I like the term general intelligence. So I don't think that the ultimate AI, if there is such a thing, is gonna look just like humans. I think it's gonna do some things that humans do better than current machines, like reason flexibly. And understand language and so forth. But it doesn't mean they have to be identical to humans. So for example, humans have terrible memory, and they suffer from what some people call motivated reasoning. So they like arguments that seem to support them, and they dismiss arguments that they don't like. There's no reason that a machine should ever do that. So you see that those limitations of memory as a bug, not a feature. Absolutely. I'll say two things about that. One is I was on a panel with Danny Kahneman, the Nobel Prize winner, last night, and we were talking about this stuff. And I think what we converged on is that humans are a low bar to exceed. They may be outside of our skill right now, but as AI programmers, but eventually AI will exceed it. So we're not talking about human level AI. We're talking about general intelligence that can do all kinds of different things and do it without some of the flaws that human beings have. The other thing I'll say is I wrote a whole book, actually, about the flaws of humans. It's actually a nice bookend to the, or counterpoint to the current book. So I wrote a book called Cluj, which was about the limits of the human mind. The current book is kind of about those few things that humans do a lot better than machines. Do you think it's possible that the flaws of the human mind, the limits of memory, our mortality, our bias, is a strength, not a weakness, that that is the thing that enables, from which motivation springs and meaning springs or not? I've heard a lot of arguments like this. I've never found them that convincing. I think that there's a lot of making lemonade out of lemons. So we, for example, do a lot of free association where one idea just leads to the next and they're not really that well connected. And we enjoy that and we make poetry out of it and we make kind of movies with free associations and it's fun and whatever. I don't think that's really a virtue of the system. I think that the limitations in human reasoning actually get us in a lot of trouble. Like, for example, politically we can't see eye to eye because we have the motivational reasoning I was talking about and something related called confirmation bias. So we have all of these problems that actually make for a rougher society because we can't get along because we can't interpret the data in shared ways. And then we do some nice stuff with that. So my free associations are different from yours and you're kind of amused by them and that's great. And hence poetry. So there are lots of ways in which we take a lousy situation and make it good. Another example would be our memories are terrible. So we play games like Concentration where you flip over two cards, try to find a pair. Can you imagine a computer playing that? Computer's like, this is the dullest game in the world. I know where all the cards are, I see it once, I know where it is, what are you even talking about? So we make a fun game out of having this terrible memory. So we are imperfect in discovering and optimizing some kind of utility function. But you think in general, there is a utility function. There's an objective function that's better than others. I didn't say that. But see, the presumption, when you say... I think you could design a better memory system. You could argue about utility functions and how you wanna think about that. But objectively, it would be really nice to do some of the following things. To get rid of memories that are no longer useful. Objectively, that would just be good. And we're not that good at it. So when you park in the same lot every day, you confuse where you parked today with where you parked yesterday with where you parked the day before and so forth. So you blur together a series of memories. There's just no way that that's optimal. I mean, I've heard all kinds of wacky arguments of people trying to defend that. But in the end of the day, I don't think any of them hold water. It's just above. Or memories of traumatic events would be possibly a very nice feature to have to get rid of those. It'd be great if you could just be like, I'm gonna wipe this sector. I'm done with that. I didn't have fun last night. I don't wanna think about it anymore. Whoop, bye bye. I'm gone. But we can't. Do you think it's possible to build a system... So you said human level intelligence is a weird concept, but... Well, I'm saying I prefer general intelligence. General intelligence. I mean, human level intelligence is a real thing. And you could try to make a machine that matches people or something like that. I'm saying that per se shouldn't be the objective, but rather that we should learn from humans the things they do well and incorporate that into our AI, just as we incorporate the things that machines do well that people do terribly. So, I mean, it's great that AI systems can do all this brute force computation that people can't. And one of the reasons I work on this stuff is because I would like to see machines solve problems that people can't, that combine the strength, or that in order to be solved would combine the strengths of machines to do all this computation with the ability, let's say, of people to read. So I'd like machines that can read the entire medical literature in a day. 7,000 new papers or whatever the numbers, comes out every day. There's no way for any doctor or whatever to read them all. A machine that could read would be a brilliant thing. And that would be strengths of brute force computation combined with kind of subtlety and understanding medicine that a good doctor or scientist has. So if we can linger a little bit on the idea of general intelligence. So Yann LeCun believes that human intelligence isn't general at all, it's very narrow. How do you think? I don't think that makes sense. We have lots of narrow intelligences for specific problems. But the fact is, like, anybody can walk into, let's say, a Hollywood movie, and reason about the content of almost anything that goes on there. So you can reason about what happens in a bank robbery, or what happens when someone is infertile and wants to go to IVF to try to have a child, or you can, the list is essentially endless. And not everybody understands every scene in the movie, but there's a huge range of things that pretty much any ordinary adult can understand. His argument is, is that actually, the set of things seems large for us humans because we're very limited in considering the kind of possibilities of experiences that are possible. But in fact, the amount of experience that are possible is infinitely larger. Well, I mean, if you wanna make an argument that humans are constrained in what they can understand, I have no issue with that. I think that's right. But it's still not the same thing at all as saying, here's a system that can play Go. It's been trained on five million games. And then I say, can it play on a rectangular board rather than a square board? And you say, well, if I retrain it from scratch on another five million games, it can. That's really, really narrow, and that's where we are. We don't have even a system that could play Go and then without further retraining, play on a rectangular board, which any human could do with very little problem. So that's what I mean by narrow. And so it's just wordplay to say. That is semantics, yeah. Then it's just words. Then yeah, you mean general in a sense that you can do all kinds of Go board shapes flexibly. Well, that would be like a first step in the right direction, but obviously that's not what it really meaning. You're kidding. What I mean by general is that you could transfer the knowledge you learn in one domain to another. So if you learn about bank robberies in movies and there's chase scenes, then you can understand that amazing scene in Breaking Bad when Walter White has a car chase scene with only one person. He's the only one in it. And you can reflect on how that car chase scene is like all the other car chase scenes you've ever seen and totally different and why that's cool. And the fact that the number of domains you can do that with is finite doesn't make it less general. So the idea of general is you could just do it on a lot of, don't transfer it across a lot of domains. Yeah, I mean, I'm not saying humans are infinitely general or that humans are perfect. I just said a minute ago, it's a low bar, but it's just, it's a low bar. But right now, like the bar is here and we're there and eventually we'll get way past it. So speaking of low bars, you've highlighted in your new book as well, but a couple of years ago wrote a paper titled Deep Learning, A Critical Appraisal that lists 10 challenges faced by current deep learning systems. So let me summarize them as data efficiency, transfer learning, hierarchical knowledge, open ended inference, explainability, integrating prior knowledge, cause of reasoning, modeling on a stable world, robustness, adversarial examples and so on. And then my favorite probably is reliability in the engineering of real world systems. So whatever people can read the paper, they should definitely read the paper, should definitely read your book. But which of these challenges is solved in your view has the biggest impact on the AI community? It's a very good question. And I'm gonna be evasive because I think that they go together a lot. So some of them might be solved independently of others, but I think a good solution to AI starts by having real, what I would call cognitive models of what's going on. So right now we have a approach that's dominant where you take statistical approximations of things, but you don't really understand them. So you know that bottles are correlated in your data with bottle caps, but you don't understand that there's a thread on the bottle cap that fits with the thread on the bottle and then that's what tightens it. If I tighten enough that there's a seal and the water won't come out. Like there's no machine that understands that. And having a good cognitive model of that kind of everyday phenomena is what we call common sense. And if you had that, then a lot of these other things start to fall into at least a little bit better place. Right now you're like learning correlations between pixels when you play a video game or something like that. And it doesn't work very well. It works when the video game is just the way that you studied it and then you alter the video game in small ways, like you move the paddle and break out a few pixels and the system falls apart. Because it doesn't understand, it doesn't have a representation of a paddle, a ball, a wall, a set of bricks and so forth. And so it's reasoning at the wrong level. So the idea of common sense, it's full of mystery, you've worked on it, but it's nevertheless full of mystery, full of promise. What does common sense mean? What does knowledge mean? So the way you've been discussing it now is very intuitive. It makes a lot of sense that that is something we should have and that's something deep learning systems don't have. But the argument could be that we're oversimplifying it because we're oversimplifying the notion of common sense because that's how it feels like we as humans at the cognitive level approach problems. So maybe. A lot of people aren't actually gonna read my book. But if they did read the book, one of the things that might come as a surprise to them is that we actually say common sense is really hard and really complicated. So they would probably, my critics know that I like common sense, but that chapter actually starts by us beating up not on deep learning, but kind of on our own home team as it will. So Ernie and I are first and foremost people that believe in at least some of what good old fashioned AI tried to do. So we believe in symbols and logic and programming. Things like that are important. And we go through why even those tools that we hold fairly dear aren't really enough. So we talk about why common sense is actually many things. And some of them fit really well with those classical sets of tools. So things like taxonomy. So I know that a bottle is an object or it's a vessel, let's say. And I know a vessel is an object and objects are material things in the physical world. So I can make some inferences. If I know that vessels need to not have holes in them, then I can infer that in order to carry their contents, then I can infer that a bottle shouldn't have a hole in it in order to carry its contents. So you can do hierarchical inference and so forth. And we say that's great, but it's only a tiny piece of what you need for common sense. We give lots of examples that don't fit into that. So another one that we talk about is a cheese grater. You've got holes in a cheese grater. You've got a handle on top. You can build a model in the game engine sense of a model so that you could have a little cartoon character flying around through the holes of the grater. But we don't have a system yet. Taxonomy doesn't help us that much that really understands why the handle is on top and what you do with the handle, or why all of those circles are sharp, or how you'd hold the cheese with respect to the grater in order to make it actually work. Do you think these ideas are just abstractions that could emerge on a system like a very large deep neural network? I'm a skeptic that that kind of emergence per se can work. So I think that deep learning might play a role in the systems that do what I want systems to do, but it won't do it by itself. I've never seen a deep learning system really extract an abstract concept. What they do, principled reasons for that stemming from how back propagation works, how the architectures are set up. One example is deep learning people actually all build in something called convolution, which Jan Lacune is famous for, which is an abstraction. They don't have their systems learn this. So the abstraction is an object that looks the same if it appears in different places. And what Lacune figured out and why, essentially why he was a co winner of the Turing Award was that if you programmed this in innately, then your system would be a whole lot more efficient. In principle, this should be learnable, but people don't have systems that kind of reify things and make them more abstract. And so what you'd really wind up with if you don't program that in advance is a system that kind of realizes that this is the same thing as this, but then I take your little clock there and I move it over and it doesn't realize that the same thing applies to the clock. So the really nice thing, you're right, that convolution is just one of the things that's like, it's an innate feature that's programmed by the human expert. We need more of those, not less. Yes, but the nice feature is it feels like that requires coming up with that brilliant idea, can get you a Turing Award, but it requires less effort than encoding and something we'll talk about, the expert system. So encoding a lot of knowledge by hand. So it feels like there's a huge amount of limitations which you clearly outline with deep learning, but the nice feature of deep learning, whatever it is able to accomplish, it does a lot of stuff automatically without human intervention. Well, and that's part of why people love it, right? But I always think of this quote from Bertrand Russell, which is it has all the advantages of theft over honest toil. It's really hard to program into a machine a notion of causality or even how a bottle works or what containers are. Ernie Davis and I wrote a, I don't know, 45 page academic paper trying just to understand what a container is, which I don't think anybody ever read the paper, but it's a very detailed analysis of all the things, well, not even all of it, some of the things you need to do in order to understand a container. It would be a whole lot nice, and I'm a coauthor on the paper, I made it a little bit better, but Ernie did the hard work for that particular paper. And it took him like three months to get the logical statements correct. And maybe that's not the right way to do it, it's a way to do it. But on that way of doing it, it's really hard work to do something as simple as understanding containers. And nobody wants to do that hard work, even Ernie didn't want to do that hard work. Everybody would rather just like feed their system in with a bunch of videos with a bunch of containers and have the systems infer how containers work. It would be like so much less effort, let the machine do the work. And so I understand the impulse, I understand why people want to do that. I just don't think that it works. I've never seen anybody build a system that in a robust way can actually watch videos and predict exactly which containers would leak and which ones wouldn't or something like, and I know someone's gonna go out and do that since I said it, and I look forward to seeing it. But getting these things to work robustly is really, really hard. So Yann LeCun, who was my colleague at NYU for many years, thinks that the hard work should go into defining an unsupervised learning algorithm that will watch videos, use the next frame basically in order to tell it what's going on. And he thinks that's the Royal road and he's willing to put in the work in devising that algorithm. Then he wants the machine to do the rest. And again, I understand the impulse. My intuition, based on years of watching this stuff and making predictions 20 years ago that still hold even though there's a lot more computation and so forth, is that we actually have to do a different kind of hard work, which is more like building a design specification for what we want the system to do, doing hard engineering work to figure out how we do things like what Yann did for convolution in order to figure out how to encode complex knowledge into the systems. The current systems don't have that much knowledge other than convolution, which is again, this objects being in different places and having the same perception, I guess I'll say. Same appearance. People don't want to do that work. They don't see how to naturally fit one with the other. I think that's, yes, absolutely. But also on the expert system side, there's a temptation to go too far the other way. So we're just having an expert sort of sit down and encode the description, the framework for what a container is, and then having the system reason the rest. From my view, one really exciting possibility is of active learning where it's continuous interaction between a human and machine. As the machine, there's kind of deep learning type extraction of information from data patterns and so on, but humans also guiding the learning procedures, guiding both the process and the framework of how the machine learns, whatever the task is. I was with you with almost everything you said except the phrase deep learning. What I think you really want there is a new form of machine learning. So let's remember, deep learning is a particular way of doing machine learning. Most often it's done with supervised data for perceptual categories. There are other things you can do with deep learning, some of them quite technical, but the standard use of deep learning is I have a lot of examples and I have labels for them. So here are pictures. This one's the Eiffel Tower. This one's the Sears Tower. This one's the Empire State Building. This one's a cat. This one's a pig and so forth. You just get millions of examples, millions of labels, and deep learning is extremely good at that. It's better than any other solution that anybody has devised, but it is not good at representing abstract knowledge. It's not good at representing things like bottles contain liquid and have tops to them and so forth. It's not very good at learning or representing that kind of knowledge. It is an example of having a machine learn something, but it's a machine that learns a particular kind of thing, which is object classification. It's not a particularly good algorithm for learning about the abstractions that govern our world. There may be such a thing. Part of what we counsel in the book is maybe people should be working on devising such things. So one possibility, just I wonder what you think about it, is that deep neural networks do form abstractions, but they're not accessible to us humans in terms of we can't. There's some truth in that. So is it possible that either current or future neural networks form very high level abstractions, which are as powerful as our human abstractions of common sense. We just can't get a hold of them. And so the problem is essentially we need to make them explainable. This is an astute question, but I think the answer is at least partly no. One of the kinds of classical neural network architecture is what we call an auto associator. It just tries to take an input, goes through a set of hidden layers, and comes out with an output. And it's supposed to learn essentially the identity function, that your input is the same as your output. So you think of it as binary numbers. You've got the one, the two, the four, the eight, the 16, and so forth. And so if you want to input 24, you turn on the 16, you turn on the eight. It's like binary one, one, and a bunch of zeros. So I did some experiments in 1998 with the precursors of contemporary deep learning. And what I showed was you could train these networks on all the even numbers, and they would never generalize to the odd number. A lot of people thought that I was, I don't know, an idiot or faking the experiment, or it wasn't true or whatever. But it is true that with this class of networks that we had in that day, that they would never ever make this generalization. And it's not that the networks were stupid, it's that they see the world in a different way than we do. They were basically concerned, what is the probability that the rightmost output node is going to be one? And as far as they were concerned, in everything they'd ever been trained on, it was a zero. That node had never been turned on, and so they figured, why turn it on now? Whereas a person would look at the same problem and say, well, it's obvious, we're just doing the thing that corresponds. The Latin for it is mutatis mutandis, we'll change what needs to be changed. And we do this, this is what algebra is. So I can do f of x equals y plus two, and I can do it for a couple of values, I can tell you if y is three, then x is five, and if y is four, x is six. And now I can do it with some totally different number, like a million, then you can say, well, obviously it's a million and two, because you have an algebraic operation that you're applying to a variable. And deep learning systems kind of emulate that, but they don't actually do it. The particular example, you could fudge a solution to that particular problem. The general form of that problem remains, that what they learn is really correlations between different input and output nodes. And they're complex correlations with multiple nodes involved and so forth. Ultimately, they're correlative, they're not structured over these operations over variables. Now, someday, people may do a new form of deep learning that incorporates that stuff, and I think it will help a lot. And there's some tentative work on things like differentiable programming right now that fall into that category. But the sort of classic stuff like people use for ImageNet doesn't have it. And you have people like Hinton going around saying, symbol manipulation, like what Marcus, what I advocate is like the gasoline engine. It's obsolete. We should just use this cool electric power that we've got with the deep learning. And that's really destructive, because we really do need to have the gasoline engine stuff that represents, I mean, I don't think it's a good analogy, but we really do need to have the stuff that represents symbols. Yeah, and Hinton as well would say that we do need to throw out everything and start over. Hinton said that to Axios, and I had a friend who interviewed him and tried to pin him down on what exactly we need to throw out, and he was very evasive. Well, of course, because we can't, if he knew. Then he'd throw it out himself. But I mean, you can't have it both ways. You can't be like, I don't know what to throw out, but I am gonna throw out the symbols. I mean, and not just the symbols, but the variables and the operations over variables. Don't forget, the operations over variables, the stuff that I'm endorsing and which John McCarthy did when he founded AI, that stuff is the stuff that we build most computers out of. There are people now who say, we don't need computer programmers anymore. Not quite looking at the statistics of how much computer programmers actually get paid right now. We need lots of computer programmers, and most of them, they do a little bit of machine learning, but they still do a lot of code, right? Code where it's like, if the value of X is greater than the value of Y, then do this kind of thing, like conditionals and comparing operations over variables. Like, there's this fantasy you can machine learn anything. There's some things you would never wanna machine learn. I would not use a phone operating system that was machine learned. Like, you made a bunch of phone calls and you recorded which packets were transmitted and you just machine learned it, it'd be insane. Or to build a web browser by taking logs of keystrokes and images, screenshots, and then trying to learn the relation between them. Nobody would ever, no rational person would ever try to build a browser that made, they would use symbol manipulation, the stuff that I think AI needs to avail itself of in addition to deep learning. Can you describe your view of symbol manipulation in its early days? Can you describe expert systems and where do you think they hit a wall or a set of challenges? Sure, so I mean, first I just wanna clarify, I'm not endorsing expert systems per se. You've been kind of contrasting them. There is a contrast, but that's not the thing that I'm endorsing. So expert systems tried to capture things like medical knowledge with a large set of rules. So if the patient has this symptom and this other symptom, then it is likely that they have this disease. So there are logical rules and they were symbol manipulating rules of just the sort that I'm talking about. And the problem. They encode a set of knowledge that the experts then put in. And very explicitly so. So you'd have somebody interview an expert and then try to turn that stuff into rules. And at some level I'm arguing for rules. But the difference is those guys did in the 80s was almost entirely rules, almost entirely handwritten with no machine learning. What a lot of people are doing now is almost entirely one species of machine learning with no rules. And what I'm counseling is actually a hybrid. I'm saying that both of these things have their advantage. So if you're talking about perceptual classification, how do I recognize a bottle? Deep learning is the best tool we've got right now. If you're talking about making inferences about what a bottle does, something closer to the expert systems is probably still the best available alternative. And probably we want something that is better able to handle quantitative and statistical information than those classical systems typically were. So we need new technologies that are gonna draw some of the strengths of both the expert systems and the deep learning, but are gonna find new ways to synthesize them. How hard do you think it is to add knowledge at the low level? So mine human intellects to add extra information to symbol manipulating systems? In some domains it's not that hard, but it's often really hard. Partly because a lot of the things that are important, people wouldn't bother to tell you. So if you pay someone on Amazon Mechanical Turk to tell you stuff about bottles, they probably won't even bother to tell you some of the basic level stuff that's just so obvious to a human being and yet so hard to capture in machines. They're gonna tell you more exotic things, and they're all well and good, but they're not getting to the root of the problem. So untutored humans aren't very good at knowing, and why should they be, what kind of knowledge the computer system developers actually need? I don't think that that's an irremediable problem. I think it's historically been a problem. People have had crowdsourcing efforts, and they don't work that well. There's one at MIT, we're recording this at MIT, called Virtual Home, where, and we talk about this in the book, find the exact example there, but people were asked to do things like describe an exercise routine. And the things that the people describe are at a very low level and don't really capture what's going on. So they're like, go to the room with the television and the weights, turn on the television, press the remote to turn on the television, lift weight, put weight down, whatever. It's like very micro level, and it's not telling you what an exercise routine is really about, which is like, I wanna fit a certain number of exercises in a certain time period, I wanna emphasize these muscles. You want some kind of abstract description. The fact that you happen to press the remote control in this room when you watch this television isn't really the essence of the exercise routine. But if you just ask people like, what did they do? Then they give you this fine grain. And so it takes a level of expertise about how the AI works in order to craft the right kind of knowledge. So there's this ocean of knowledge that we all operate on. Some of them may not even be conscious, or at least we're not able to communicate it effectively. Yeah, most of it we would recognize if somebody said it, if it was true or not, but we wouldn't think to say that it's true or not. That's a really interesting mathematical property. This ocean has the property that every piece of knowledge in it, we will recognize it as true if we're told, but we're unlikely to retrieve it in the reverse. So that interesting property, I would say there's a huge ocean of that knowledge. What's your intuition? Is it accessible to AI systems somehow? Can we? So you said this. I mean, most of it is not, well, I'll give you an asterisk on this in a second, but most of it has not ever been encoded in machine interpretable form. And so, I mean, if you say accessible, there's two meanings of that. One is like, could you build it into a machine? Yes. The other is like, is there some database that we could go download and stick into our machine? But the first thing, could we? What's your intuition? I think we could. I think it hasn't been done right. You know, the closest, and this is the asterisk, is the CYC psych system tried to do this. A lot of logicians worked for Doug Lennon for 30 years on this project. I think they stuck too closely to logic, didn't represent enough about probabilities, tried to hand code it. There are various issues, and it hasn't been that successful. That is the closest existing system to trying to encode this. Why do you think there's not more excitement slash money behind this idea currently? There was. People view that project as a failure. I think that they confuse the failure of a specific instance that was conceived 30 years ago for the failure of an approach, which they don't do for deep learning. So in 2010, people had the same attitude towards deep learning. They're like, this stuff doesn't really work. And all these other algorithms work better and so forth. And then certain key technical advances were made, but mostly it was the advent of graphics processing units that changed that. It wasn't even anything foundational in the techniques. And there was some new tricks, but mostly it was just more compute and more data, things like ImageNet that didn't exist before that allowed deep learning. And it could be, to work, it could be that CYC just needs a few more things or something like CYC, but the widespread view is that that just doesn't work. And people are reasoning from a single example. They don't do that with deep learning. They don't say nothing that existed in 2010, and there were many, many efforts in deep learning was really worth anything. I mean, really, there's no model from 2010 in deep learning or the predecessors of deep learning that has any commercial value whatsoever at this point. They're all failures. But that doesn't mean that there wasn't anything there. I have a friend, I was getting to know him, and he said, I had a company too, I was talking about I had a new company. He said, I had a company too, and it failed. And I said, well, what did you do? And he said, deep learning. And the problem was he did it in 1986 or something like that. And we didn't have the tools then, or 1990, we didn't have the tools then, not the algorithms. His algorithms weren't that different from model algorithms, but he didn't have the GPUs to run it fast enough. He didn't have the data. And so it failed. It could be that symbol manipulation per se with modern amounts of data and compute and maybe some advance in compute for that kind of compute might be great. My perspective on it is not that we want to resuscitate that stuff per se, but we want to borrow lessons from it, bring together with other things that we've learned. And it might have an ImageNet moment where it would spark the world's imagination and there'll be an explosion of symbol manipulation efforts. Yeah, I think that people at AI2, Paul Allen's AI Institute, are trying to build data sets. Well, they're not doing it for quite the reason that you say, but they're trying to build data sets that at least spark interest in common sense reasoning. To create benchmarks. Benchmarks for common sense. That's a large part of what the AI2.org is working on right now. So speaking of compute, Rich Sutton wrote a blog post titled Bitter Lesson. I don't know if you've read it, but he said that the biggest lesson that can be read from so many years of AI research is that general methods that leverage computation are ultimately the most effective. Do you think that? The most effective at what? Right, so they have been most effective for perceptual classification problems and for some reinforcement learning problems. And he works on reinforcement learning. Well, no, let me push back on that. You're actually absolutely right. But I would also say they have been most effective generally because everything we've done up to... Would you argue against that? Is, to me, deep learning is the first thing that has been successful at anything in AI. And you're pointing out that this success is very limited, folks, but has there been something truly successful before deep learning? Sure, I mean, I want to make a larger point, but on the narrower point, classical AI is used, for example, in doing navigation instructions. It's very successful. Everybody on the planet uses it now, like multiple times a day. That's a measure of success, right? So I don't think classical AI was wildly successful, but there are cases like that. They're just used all the time. Nobody even notices them because they're so pervasive. So there are some successes for classical AI. I think deep learning has been more successful, but my usual line about this, and I didn't invent it, but I like it a lot, is just because you can build a better ladder doesn't mean you can build a ladder to the moon. So the bitter lesson is if you have a perceptual classification problem, throwing a lot of data at it is better than anything else. But that has not given us any material progress in natural language understanding, common sense reasoning, like a robot would need to navigate a home. Problems like that, there's no actual progress there. So flip side of that, if we remove data from the picture, another bitter lesson is that you just have a very simple algorithm, and you wait for compute to scale. It doesn't have to be learning. It doesn't have to be deep learning. It doesn't have to be data driven, but just wait for the compute. So my question for you, do you think compute can unlock some of the things with either deep learning or symbol manipulation that? Sure, but I'll put a proviso on that. I think more compute's always better. Nobody's gonna argue with more compute. It's like having more money. I mean, there's the data. There's diminishing returns on more money. Exactly, there's diminishing returns on more money, but nobody's gonna argue if you wanna give them more money, right? Except maybe the people who signed the giving pledge, and some of them have a problem. They've promised to give away more money than they're able to. But the rest of us, if you wanna give me more money, fine. I'm saying more money, more problems, but okay. That's true too. What I would say to you is your brain uses like 20 watts, and it does a lot of things that deep learning doesn't do, or that symbol manipulation doesn't do, that AI just hasn't figured out how to do. So it's an existence proof that you don't need server resources that are Google scale in order to have an intelligence. I built, with a lot of help from my wife, two intelligences that are 20 watts each, and far exceed anything that anybody else has built at a silicon. Speaking of those two robots, what have you learned about AI from having? Well, they're not robots, but. Sorry, intelligent agents. Those two intelligent agents. I've learned a lot by watching my two intelligent agents. I think that what's fundamentally interesting, well, one of the many things that's fundamentally interesting about them is the way that they set their own problems to solve. So my two kids are a year and a half apart. They're both five and six and a half. They play together all the time, and they're constantly creating new challenges. That's what they do, is they make up games, and they're like, well, what if this, or what if that, or what if I had this superpower, or what if you could walk through this wall? So they're doing these what if scenarios all the time, and that's how they learn something about the world and grow their minds, and machines don't really do that. So that's interesting, and you've talked about this, you've written about it, you've thought about it, nature versus nurture. So what innate knowledge do you think we're born with, and what do we learn along the way in those early months and years? Can I just say how much I like that question? You phrased it just right, and almost nobody ever does, which is what is the innate knowledge and what's learned along the way? So many people dichotomize it, and they think it's nature versus nurture, when it is obviously has to be nature and nurture. They have to work together. You can't learn this stuff along the way unless you have some innate stuff, but just because you have the innate stuff doesn't mean you don't learn anything. And so many people get that wrong, including in the field. People think if I work in machine learning, the learning side, I must not be allowed to work on the innate side, or that will be cheating. Exactly, people have said that to me, and it's just absurd, so thank you. But you could break that apart more. I've talked to folks who studied the development of the brain, and the growth of the brain in the first few days in the first few months in the womb, all of that, is that innate? So that process of development from a stem cell to the growth of the central nervous system and so on, to the information that's encoded through the long arc of evolution. So all of that comes into play, and it's unclear. It's not just whether it's a dichotomy or not. It's where most, or where the knowledge is encoded. So what's your intuition about the innate knowledge, the power of it, what's contained in it, what can we learn from it? One of my earlier books was actually trying to understand the biology of this. The book was called The Birth of the Mind. Like how is it the genes even build innate knowledge? And from the perspective of the conversation we're having today, there's actually two questions. One is what innate knowledge or mechanisms, or what have you, people or other animals might be endowed with. I always like showing this video of a baby ibex climbing down a mountain. That baby ibex, a few hours after its birth, knows how to climb down a mountain. That means that it knows, not consciously, something about its own body and physics and 3D geometry and all of this kind of stuff. So there's one question about what does biology give its creatures and what has evolved in our brains? How is that represented in our brains? The question I thought about in the book The Birth of the Mind. And then there's a question of what AI should have. And they don't have to be the same.\n",

      "Text: The universe doesn't care about your personal narrative. You can just have met the person that is going to be the love of your life. It's the culmination of your whole project for happiness, and you step into the street and a truck hits you and you die. That's mortality. Mortality isn't just some far flung event. It's that every moment we are subject to fate in that way. So you can think of lots of little deaths you experience whenever all the projects and the plans you make come up against the fact that the universe can just roll over them. The following is a conversation with John Verweke, a psychologist and cognitive scientist at the University of Toronto. I highly recommend his lecture series called Awakening from the Meaning Crisis, which covers the history and future of humanity's search for meaning. This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's John Verweke. You have an excellent 50 part lecture series online on the Meaning Crisis. And I think you describe in the modern times an increase in depression, loneliness, cynicism, and wait for it, bullshit. The term used technically by Harry Frankfurt and adopted by you. So let me ask, what is meaning? What are we looking for when we engage in the search for meaning? So when I'm talking about meaning, I'm talking about what's called meaning in life, not the meaning of life. That's some sort of metaphysical claim. Meaning in life are those factors that make people rate their lives as more meaningful, worth living, worth the suffering that they have to endure. And when you study that, what you see is it's a sense of connectedness, connectedness to yourself, to other people, to the world, and a particular kind of connectedness. You want to be connected to things that have a value and an existence independent of your egocentric preferences and concerns. This is why, for example, having a child is considered very meaningful, because you're connecting to something that's going to have a life and a value independent of you. Now, the question that comes up for me, well, there's two questions. One is, why is that at risk right now? And then secondly, and I think you have to answer the second question first, which is, well, yeah, but why is meaning so important? Why is this sense of connectedness so important to human beings? Why, when it is lacking, do they typically fall into depression, potentially mental illness, addiction, self destructive behavior? And so the first answer I give you is, well, it's that sense of connectedness. And people often express it metaphorically. They want to be connected to something larger than themselves. They want to matter. They don't mean it literally. I mean, if I chained you to a mountain, you wouldn't thereby say, oh, now my life is so fulfilling, right? So what they're trying to convey, they're using this metaphor to try and say, they want to be connected. They want to be connected to something real. They want to make a difference and matter to it. And one way of asking them, well, you know, what's meaningful is, tell me what you would like to continue to exist even if you weren't around anymore, and how are you connected to it, and how do you matter to it? That's one way of trying to get at what is the source of meaning for you, is if you were no longer there, you would like it to continue existing. That's not the only part of the definition probably, because there's probably many things that aren't a source of meaning for me that maybe I find beautiful that I would like to continue existing. Yes. If it contributes to your life being meaningful, you are connected to it in some way, and it matters to you, and you matter to it in that you make some difference to it. That's when it goes from being just sort of true, good, and beautiful, to being a source of meaning for you in your life. Is the meaning crisis a new thing, or has it always been with us? Is it part of the human condition in general? That's an excellent question. And part of the argument I made in Awakening from the Meaning Crisis is there's two aspects to it. One is that there are perennial problems, perennial threats to meaning. And in that sense, human beings are always vulnerable to despair. You know, the book of Ecclesiastes is, it's all vanity, it's all meaningless. But there's also historical forces that have made those perennial problems more pertinent, more pressing, more difficult for people to deal with. And so the meaning crisis is actually the intersection of perennial problems, finding existence absurd, experiencing existential anxiety, feeling alienated, and then pressing historical factors, which have to do with the loss of the resources that human beings have typically cross historically and cross culturally made use of in order to address these perennial problems. Is there something potentially deeper than just a lack of meaning that speaks to the fact that we're vulnerable to despair? You know, Ernest Becker talked about the, in his book Denial of Death, about the fear of death and being an important motivator in our life. As William James said, death is the warm at the core of the human condition. Is it possible that this kind of search for meaning is coupled or can be seen from the perspective of trying to escape the reality, the thought of one's own mortality? Yeah, Becker and the terror management theory that have come out of it, there's been some good work around sort of providing empirical support for that claim. Some of the work, not so good. So which aspects do you find convincing? Can you steel man that case and then can you argue against it? So what aspects I find convincing is that human finitude, being finite, being inherently limited is very problematic for us. Given the extensive use of the word problematic, I like that you used that word to describe one's own mortality as problematic. Because people sort of on Twitter use the word problematic when they disagree with somebody. But this, to me, seems to be the ultimate problematic aspect of the human condition is that we die and it ends. I think I'm not disagreeing with you, but I'm trying to get you to consider that your mortality is not an event in the future. It's a state you're in right now. That's what I'm trying to shift. So your mortality is just a... We talk about something that causes mortality fatal. But what we actually mean is it's full of fate. And I don't mean in the sense of things are prewritten. What I mean is the sense of the universe doesn't care about your personal narrative. You can just have met the person that is going to be the love of your life. It's the culmination of your whole project for happiness, and you step into the street and a truck hits you and you die. That's mortality. Mortality isn't just some far flung event. It's that every moment we are subject to fate in that way. So you can think of lots of little deaths you experience whenever all the projects and the plans you make come up against the fact that the universe can just roll over them. The death is the indifference of nature of the universe to your existence. And so in that sense, it is always here with us. Yeah, but you're vulnerable in so many ways other than just the ending of your biological life. Because it's interesting, if you rate what people fear most, death is not number one. They often put public speaking as number one. Because the death of status or reputation can also be a profound loss for human beings. It can drive them into despair. So as the terror management folks would say, as Ernest Becker would say, that a self report on a survey is not an accurate way to capture what is actually at the core of the motivation of a human being. That we could be terrified of death. And we, from childhood, since we realized the absurdity of the fact that the right ends, we've learned to really try to forget about it, try to construct illusions that allow us to escape momentarily or for prolonged periods of time the realization that we die. Okay, so first, I took it seriously, but now I want to say why there's some empirical work that makes me want to reconsider it. So terror management theory is you do things like you give people a list of words to read. And in those lists are words associated with death, cough, and funeral. And then you see what happens to people. And generally, they start to become more rigid in their thinking. They tend to identify with their worldview. They lose cognitive flexibility. That's if you present it to them in that third person perspective. But if you get them to go in the first person perspective and imagine that they're dying and that the people that they care about are there with them, they don't show those responses. In fact, they show us an increase in cognitive flexibility, an increase in openness. See, so I'm trying to say we might be putting the cart before the horse. It might not be death per se, but the kind of meaning that is present or absent in death that is the crucial thing for us. By the way, to push back, I don't think you took it seriously. I don't think you truly steel manned the case because you're saying that death is always present with us, yes, but isn't there a case to be made that it is one of the major motivators? Nietzsche, will to power, Freud wanting to have sex with your mother, all the different explanations of what is truly motivating us human beings. Isn't there a strong case to be made that this death thing is a really damn good, if not anything, a tool to motivate the behavior of humans? I'm not saying that the avoidance of death is not significant for human beings, but I'm proposing to you that human beings have a capacity for considering certain deaths meaningful and certain deaths meaningless, and we have lots of evidence that people are willing to sacrifice their biological existence for a death they consider meaningful. Are you personally afraid of your death if you think about it? As somebody who produces a lot of ideas, records them, writes them down, is a deep thinker, admired thinker, and as the years go on, become more and more admired, does it scare you that the ride ends? No. I mean, you have to talk to me on all my levels. I'm a biological organism, so if something's thrown at my head, I'll duck and things like that. But if you're asking me, do I long to live forever, no. In the Buddhist tradition, there are practices that are designed to make you aware of simultaneously the horror of mortality and the horror of immortality. The thought of living forever is actually horrific to me. Are those the only two options? Like when you're sitting with a loved one or watching a movie you just really love or a book you really love, you don't want it to end, you don't necessarily always flip it to the other aspect, the complete opposite of the thought experiment. What happens if the book lasts forever? There's got to be a middle ground, like the snooze button. Sure you don't want to sleep forever, but maybe press the snooze button and get an extra 15 minutes. There's surely some kind of balance, that fear seems to be a source of an intense appreciation of the moment, in part, and that's what the Stoics talked about, sort of the meditate on one's mortality. Sure. It seems to be a nice wake up call to that life is full of moments that are beautiful and then you don't get an infinite number of them. Right, and the Stoic response was not the project of trying to extend the duration of your life, but to deepen those moments so they become as satisfying as possible so that when death comes it does not strike you as any kind of calamity. Does that project ring true for your own personal feelings? I think so. Do you think about your mortality? I used to. I don't so much anymore. Part of it, as I'm older and your temporal horizon flips somewhere in your 30s or 40s, you don't live from your birth, you live towards your death. That's such a beautiful phrase, the temporal horizon flips. That's so true. That's so true. At what point is that? The point before which the world of opportunity and possibility is infinite before you. Yeah, it's like Peter Pan. There's all these golden possibilities and you fly around between them. Yes, very much. And then when it flips, you start to look for a different model, the Socratic, the Stoic model, Buddhism has also influenced me, which is more about, wait, when I look at my desires, I seem to have two meta desires. In addition to satisfying a particular desire, I want whatever satisfies my desire to be real and whatever is satisfying my desire to not cause internal conflict but bring something like peace of mind. And so I more and more move towards how can I live such that those two meta desires are a constant frame within which I'm trying to satisfy my specific desires. What do you think happens after we die? I think mind and life go away completely when we die. And I think that's actually significantly important for the kind of beings that we are. We are the kinds of beings that can come to that awareness and then we have a responsibility to decide how we're going to comport ourselves towards it. Can you linger on what that means, the mind goes away? Like when you're playing music and the last instrument is put down, the song is over. Doesn't mean the song wasn't beautiful. Doesn't mean the song wasn't complex. Doesn't mean the song didn't add to the value of the universe and its existence, but it came to an end. Is there some aspect in which some part of mind was there before the human and remains after? Something like panpsychism or is it too much for us limited cognitive beings to understand? Something like panpsychism, I take it seriously. I don't think it's a ridiculous proposal, but I think it has insoluble problems that make me doubt it. Any idea that the mind is some kind of ultimately immaterial substance also has for me just devastating problems. Those are the two kinds of framework that people usually propose in order to support some kind of idea of immortality. I find both very problematic. The fact that we participate in distributed cognition, that most of our problem solving is not done as individuals but in groups, this is something I work on, I've published on that. I think that's important. But most of the people who do work on systems of distributed cognition think that while there's such a thing as collective intelligence, there's no good evidence that there's collective consciousness. In fact, it's often called zombie agency for that reason. And so while I think it's very clear that no one person runs an airline, and there's a collective intelligence that solves that problem, I do not think that collective intelligence supports any kind of consciousness. And so therefore, I don't think the fact that I participate, which I regularly and reliably do in distributed cognition, gives me any reason to believe that that participation grounds some kind of consciousness. Okay, there's so many things to mention there. First of all, distributed cognition, maybe that's a synonym for collective intelligence. So that means a bunch of humans individually are able to think, have cognitive machines, and are somehow able to interact through the process of dialogue, as you talk about, to morph different ideas together, like this idea landscape together. It's so interesting to think about, okay, well, you do have these fascinating distributed cognition systems, but consciousness does not propagate in the same way as intelligence. But isn't there a case, if we just look at intelligence, if we look at us humans as a collection of smaller organisms, which we are, and so there's like a hierarchy of organisms, tiny ones, work together to form tiny villages that you can then start to see as individual organisms that are then also forming bigger villages and interacting different ways and function becomes more and more complex. And eventually we get to us humans to where we start to think, well, we're an individual, but really we're not. There's billions of organisms inside us, both domestic and foreign. So isn't that building up consciousnesses like turtles all the way up to us, our consciousness? Why does it have to stop with us humans? Are we the only, like, is this the phase transition when it becomes a zombie like giant hierarchical village that first like, oh, there's like a singing angels and it's consciousness is born in just us humans. Do bacteria have consciousness? Not bacteria, but maybe you could say bacteria does, but like the interesting complicated organisms that are within us have consciousness. I think it's proper to argue, and I have, that like a paramecium or bacteria has a kind possibly find out, it is irrational for me to pay any attention to that possibility. So I could keep doing the science as I'm doing it. If there's a way of finding out, science is my best bet, I believe, for finding out if it's, what's true and what's an illusion. So I keep doing what I'm doing. So it's an argument if you move it to that, that makes no existential difference to me. Oh man, that is such a deeply philosophical argument. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Nobody's saying science doesn't work. It's an interesting question, just like before humans were able to fly, they would ask a question, can we build the machine that makes us fly? In that same way, we're asking a question to which we don't know an answer, but we may know in the future, how much of this whole thing is an illusion? And I think in a second category, the first, I forgot which one, yes, science will be able to help us discover this. Otherwise, yes, for sure, that doesn't matter. If we're living in a simulation, we can't find out at all, then it doesn't matter. But yes, the whole point is as we get deeper and deeper understanding of our mind of cognition, we might be able to discover like how much of this is a big charade constructed by our mind to keep us fed or something like that. Some weird, some weird, very simplistic explanation that it will ultimately in its simplicity be beautiful, or as we try to build robots and instill them, instill them with consciousness, with ability to feel, those kinds of things, we'll discover, well, let's just trick them into thinking they feel and have consciousness and they'll believe it. And then they'll have a deeply fulfilling and meaningful lives. And on top of that, they will interact with us in a way that will make our lives more meaningful. And then all of a sudden, it's like at the end of Animal Farm, you look at pigs and humans and you look at robots and humans and you can't tell the difference between either. And we in that way start to understand that much of this existence could be an illusion. Okay, well, I have two responses to that. First is the progress that's being made on like AGI is about making whatever the system is that's going to be the source of intelligent more and more dynamically and recursively self correcting. That's part of what's happening. Extrapolating from that, you get a system that gets better and better at self correcting, but that's exactly what I was describing before as the transformative theory of truth. The other response to that is people think of science just as sort of end proposition. Let me just use the evolutionary example again, right? If I'm gathering the evidence, I need to know a lot of geology, I need to know plate tectonics, I need to know about radioactive decay, I need to know about genetics, and then in order to measure all those things, I need to know how microscopes work, I need to know how pencils and paper work, I need to know how rulers work, I need to know how English... You can't isolate knowledge that way. And if you say, well, most of that's an illusion, then you're in a weird position of saying somehow all of these illusions get to this truth claim. I think it goes in reverse. If you think this is the truth claim, the measuring and all the things that scientists would do to gather on all the ways the theories are converging together, that also has to be fundamentally right, because it's not like Lego, it is an interwoven whole. Yes, it definitely is interwoven, but I love how I'm playing the devil advocate for the illusion world. But there's an aspect to truth that has to be consistent, deeply consistent across an entire system. But inside a video game, that same kind of consistency evolves. There's rules about interactions, there's game theoretic patterns about what's good and bad and so on, and there's sources of joy and fear and anger, and then understanding about a world, what happens in different dynamics of a video game, even simple video games. So there's no, even inside an illusion, you can have consistency and develop truths inside that illusion and iteratively evolve your truth with the illusion. Okay, but that comes back. Is that process genuinely self correcting, or are you in the simulation in which there is no possible doorway out? Because if, my argument is, if you find one or two doorways, that feeds back. In fact, you can't just say, this is the little tiny island where we have the truth. That's the point I'm making. Right. But what if you find that, I think there is doorways, if that's the case. And what if you find a doorway and you step out, but you're yet in another simulation? I mean, that's the point. That's so self correcting. When you fix the self deception, you don't know if there's other bigger self deceptions you're operating on. Of course. That makes sense. That's right. But again, we're back to when I step into the second simulation, is it, can I get the doorway out of that or right? Because if you just make the infinite regressive simulations, you basically said, I have a simulation that I can never get out of. Yeah. I think there's always a bigger pile of bullshit is the claim I'm trying to make here. Okay. Let me dance around meaning once more. Sure. I ask people on this podcast or at a bar or to imaginary people I talk to in a room when I'm all by myself, the question of the meaning of life. Do you think this is a useful question? You drew a line between meaning in life and meaning of life. Do you think this is a useful question? No, I think it's like the question, what's north of the North Pole or what time is it on the sun? It sounds like a question, but it's actually not really a question because it has a presupposition in it that I think is fundamentally flawed. If I understand what people mean by it, and it's actually often not that clear, but when they talk about the meaning of life, they are talking about there are some feature of the universe in and of itself that I have to discover and enter into a relationship with and there's in that sense, a plan for me or something. And so that's a property of the universe. That's a very deep, serious, metaphysical, ontological claim. You're claiming to know something fundamental about the structure of reality. There were times when people thought they had a worldview that legitimated it, like God is running the universe and God cares about you and there's a plan, et cetera. But I think a better way of understanding meaning is not... Meaning is like the graspability. Remember, I talked about optimal grip, it's like the graspability of that cup. Is that in me? No. Is it in the cup? No, because a fly can't grasp it. Well, graspability is in my hand, well, I can't grasp Africa. No, no, there is a real relation, fittedness between me and this cup. Same thing with the adaptivity of an organism. Is the adaptivity of a great white shark in the great white shark? Drop it in the Sahara, dies, okay? Meaning isn't in me, I think that's romantic bullshit, and it isn't in the universe, it is a proper relationship. I've coined the phrase transjective, it is the binding relationship between the subjective and the objective. And therefore, when you're asking the question about the meaning of life, you are, I think, misrepresenting the nature of meaning. Just like when you ask, what time is it on the sun? You're misrepresenting how we derive clock time. At the risk of disagreeing with a man who did 50 lectures on the meaning crisis, let me hard disagree. But I think we probably agree, but it's just like a dance, like any dialogue. I think meaning of life gets at the same kind of relationship between you and the glass of water, between whatever the forces of the universe that created the planets, the proteins, the multi cell organisms, the intelligent early humans, the beautiful human civilizations and the technologies that will overtake them. It's trying to understand the relevance realization of the Big Bang to the feeling of love you have for another human being. It's reaching for that, even though it's hopeless to understand. It's the question, the asking of the question is the reaching. Now it is, in fact, romantic bullshit, technically speaking. But it could be that romantic bullshit is actually the essence of life and the source of its deepest meaning. Well, I hope not. But technically speaking, romantic bullshit, meaning romantic in the philosophical sense, yes. I mean, what is poetry? What is music? What is the magic you feel when you hear a beautiful piece of music? What is that? Oh, but that's exactly to my point. Is music inside you or is it outside you? It's both and neither. And that's precisely why you find it so meaningful. In fact, it can be so meaningful you can regard it as sacred. What you said, I don't think, and you preface that we might not be in disagreement, right? What you said is, no, no, no, there is a way in which reality is realizing itself. And I want my relevance realization to be in the best possible relationship, the sort of meta optimal grip to what is most real. I totally agree. I totally think that's one of the things, I said this earlier, one of our meta desires is whatever is satisfying our desires is also real. I do this with my students, I'll say, you know, because romantic relationships sort of take the role of God and religion and history and culture for us right now. We put everything on them and that's why they break, right? Strong words. Got it. But I'll say to them, okay, how many of you are in really satisfying romantic relationships? Put up your hands. Then I'll say, okay, I'm now only talking to these people. Of those people, how many of you would want to know your partner's cheating on you even if it means the destruction of the relationship, 95% of them put up their hands. And I say, but why? And here's my students who are usually all sort of bitten with cynicism and postmodernism and they'll just say spontaneously, well, because it's not real, because it's not real. Right. So I think what you're pointing to is actually, you're pointing not to an objective or a subjective thing. Empiricism says it's subjective. There's some sort of, I guess, like positivism or Lockean empiricism says it's objective, but you're saying, no, no, no, there's reality realization and can I get relevance realization to be optimally gripping in the best right relationship with it? And there's good reason you can because think about it, your relevance realization isn't just representing properties of the world, it's instantiating it. There's something very similar to biological evolution, which is that the guts of life, if I'm right, running your cognition, it's not just that you have ideas, you actually instantiate, that's what I mean by conformity, the same principles. They're within and without, they don't belong to you subjectively. They're not just out there, they're both at the same time. And they help to explain how you are actually bound to the evolutionary world. Yeah. So it comes from both inside and from the outside. But there's still the question of the meaning of life, first of all, the big benefit of that question is that it shakes you out of your hamster in a wheel that is daily life, the mundane process of daily life, where you have a schedule, you wake up, you have kids, you have to take them to school, then you go to work and the da da da da da and repeats over and over and over and over and then you get increased salary and then you upgrade to home and that whole process. Asking about the meaning of life is so full of romantic bullshit that if you just allow yourself to take it seriously for a second, it forces you to pause and think, what's going on here? And then it ultimately, I think, does return to the question of meaning in those mundane things. What gives my life joy? What gives it lasting deliciousness? Where do I notice the magic and how can I have that magic return again and again? Beauty. And that ultimately what it returns to. But it's the same thing you do when you look up to the sky. You spend most of your day hurrying around looking at things on the surface, but when you look up to the sky and you see the stars, it fills you with the feeling of awe that forces you to pause and think in full context of like, what the hell is going on here? That, but also I think there is a, when you think too much about the meaning of a glass and relevance realization of a glass, you don't necessarily get at the core of what makes music beautiful. So sometimes you have to start at the biggest picture first. And I think meaning of life forces you to really go to the big bang and go to the universe and the whole thing, the origin of life. And I think sometimes you have to start there to discover the meaning in the day to day, I think, but perhaps you would disagree. In so far as the question makes you ask about the whole of your life and how much meaning is in the whole of your life. And in so far as it asks how much that is connected to reality, it's a good question. But it's a bad question in that it also makes you look for the answers in the wrong way. Now you said, and I agree with what you said, how we really answer this question is we come back to the meaning in life and we see how much that meaning in life is connected to reality. We pursue wisdom. And so for me, I don't need that question in order to provoke me into that stance. So let's return to the meaning crisis. Yes. What is the nature of the meaning crisis in modern times? What's its origin? What's its explanation? Well, remember what I said, what I argued, that the very processes that make us adaptively intelligent subject us to perennial problems of self deception, self destruction, creating bullshit for ourselves, for other people, all of that. And that can cause anxiety, existential anxiety, it can cause despair, it can cause a sense of absurdity. These are perennial problems. And across cultures and across historical periods, human beings have come up with ecologies of practices, there's no one practice, there's no panacea practice, they've come up with ecologies of practices for ameliorating that self deception and enhancing that fittedness, that connectedness that's at the core of meaning in life. That's prototypically what we call wisdom. And here's how I can show you one clear instance of the meaning crisis, is it's a wisdom famine. I do this regularly with my students. In the classroom I'll say, where do you go for information? They hold up their phone. Where do you go for knowledge? They're a little bit slower and probably because they're in my class, they'll say, well, science, the university. I'll say, where do you go for wisdom? There's a silence. Wisdom isn't optional, that's why it is perennial, cross cultural, cross historical, because of the perennial problems. But we do not have homes for ecologies of practices that fit into our scientific technological worldview so that they are considered legitimate. The fastest growing demographic group are the nones, N O N E S. They have no religious allegiance, but they are not primarily atheistic. They most frequently describe themselves with this very, this has become almost everybody now describes, I'm spiritual but not religious, which means they are trying to find a way of reducing the bullshit and enhancing the connectedness, but they don't want to turn to any of the legacy established religions by and large. Well isn't both religion and the nones, isn't wisdom a process, not a destination? So trying to find, if you're a deeply faithful religious person, you're also trying to find, right? So just because you have a place where you're looking or a set of traditions around which you're constructing the search, it's nevertheless a search. So I guess, is there a case to be made that this is just the usual human condition? How do you answer? If you asked five centuries ago, where do you look for wisdom? I mean, I suppose people would be more inclined to answer, well, the Bible or a religious text. Right. And they had a worldview that was considered not just religious, but also rational. So we now have these two things, orthogonal or often oppositional, spirituality and rationality. But if you go before a particular historical period, you look back in the Neoplatonic tradition, like before the scientific revolution, those two are not in opposition. They are deeply interwoven so that you can have a sense of legitimacy and deep realness and grounding in your practices. We don't have that anymore. And I'm not advocating for religion, neither am I an enemy of religion. I'll strengthen your case, by the way. So one of my RAs did research, and you get people who have committed themselves to cultivating wisdom. And you can look at people within religious traditions and people who are doing it in a purely secular framework. By many of the measures we use to study wisdom scientifically, the people in the religious paths do better than the secular. But here's the important point, there's no significant difference between the religious paths. So it's not like if you're following the path of Judaism, you're more likely to end up wiser than if you follow Buddhism. By the way, I don't know if that's my case. I was making the case that you don't need to have a religious affiliation to search for wisdom. It's that I thought along to the point you just made, that it doesn't matter which religious affiliation or none. But that's what I'm saying. Okay, so this is the tricky thing we're in. It does matter if you're in one, but it doesn't matter sort of the propositional creeds of that. There's something else at work. If you'll allow me this, there's a functionality to religion that we lost when we rejected all the propositional dogma. But there's a functionality there that we don't know how to recreate. Yeah. What is that? Can you try to speak to that? What is that functionality? What is that? Why is that so useful? A bunch of stories, a bunch of myths, a bunch of narratives that are drenched in deep lessons about morality and all those kinds of things. What's the functional thing there that can't be replaced without a religious text by a nonreligious text? This is, for me, the golden question. So thank you. Do you have an answer? Yeah. I think I have a significant answer. I don't think it's complete, but I think it's important. And this is to step before the Cartesian revolution and think about many different kinds of knowing. And this is now something that is prominent within what's called 4E cognitive science, the kind of cognitive science I practice. And there's a lot of converging evidence for these different ways of knowing. There's propositional knowing. This is what we are most familiar with. In fact, it almost has a tyrannical status, right? This is knowing that something is the case, like that cats are mammals and it's stored in semantic memory, and we have tests of coherence and correspondence and conviction, right? There's procedural knowing. This is knowing how to do something. Skills are not theories. They're not beliefs. They're not true or false. They engage the world or they don't. And they are stored in a different kind of memory, procedural memory. Semantic memory can be damaged without any damage to procedural memory. That's why you have the prototypical story of somebody suffering Alzheimer's and they're losing all kinds of facts, but they can still sit down and play the piano flawlessly. Same kind of argument. There's perspectival knowing. This is knowing what it's like to be you here now in this situation, in this state of mind, the whole field of your salience landscaping, what it's like to be you here now. And you have a specific kind of memory around that, episodic memory, and you have a different criterion of realness. So you can get this by my friend Dan Schiappi and I, we studied the scientists using moving the rovers around, or you can take a look at people who are doing VR. People talk about they want to really be in the game, and that makes it real. They don't mean verisimilitude. You can get that sense of being in the game with something like Tetris, which doesn't look like the real world, and you can fail to have it in a video game that has a lot of verisimilitude. It's something else. It's about, again, this kind of connectedness that we're talking about. If I may interrupt, is that connected to the hard problem of consciousness, the subject, the qualia, or is that a different, that kind of knowing, is that different from the quality of consciousness? I think it has to do with, well, I make a distinction between the adjectival and the adverbial qualia, so I think it has to do with the adverbial qualia much more than with the adjectival. So the adjectival qualia are like the greenness of green and the blueness of blue. The adverbial qualia are the hereness, the nowness, the togetherness. And I think the perspectival knowing has a lot to do with the adverbial qualia. Adjectival qualia and adverbial qualia. I'm learning so many new things today. Okay, so that's another way of knowing. Right, the perspectival, and then there's a deeper one. And this is a philosophical point, and I don't want to, we can go through the argument, but you don't have to know that you know in order to know, because if you start doing that, you get an infinite regress. There has to be kinds of knowing that doesn't mean you know that you know that. Yeah. Okay. Of course. Okay, great. Okay, good. Well, there was a lot of ink spilled over that over a 40 year period, so. My philosophers, they spill, this is what they do, they spill ink to get paid for ink spillage. So I want to talk about what I call participatory knowing. This is the idea that you and the world are co participating in things and such that real affordances exist between you. So both me and this environment are shaped by gravity, so the affordance of walking becomes available to me. Both me and a lot of this environment are shaped by my biology, and so affordances for that are here. Look at this cup, shared physics, shared sort of biological factors, my hand, I'm bipedal, also culture is shaping me and shaping this. I had to learn how to use that and treat it as a cup. So this is an agent arena relationship, right? Use identities being created in your agency, identities being created in the world as an arena so you and the world fit together. You know when that's missing, when you're really lonely, or you're homesick, or you're suffering culture shock. So this is participatory knowing, and it's the sense of, it comes with a sense of belonging. At every level. So the ability to walk is a kind of knowing. Yes. Yes. That there's a dance between the physics that enables this process and just participating in the process is the act of knowing. Right. And there's a really weird form of memory you have for this kind of knowing, it's called yourself. What? Can you elaborate? Well, you do, so we talked about how all the different other kinds of knowing had specific kinds of memory, semantic memory for propositional, procedural, episodic for perspectival. What's the kind of memory that is the coordinated storehouse of all of your agent arena relationships? All the roles you can take, all the identities you can assume, all the identities you can assign. Yeah, what's the self? Do you mean like consciousness? No, I mean your sense of self. Sense of self in this world that's not consciousness. It's like an agency or something. Right, it's an agent arena relationship. And so in an agent arena relationship, it's the sense of the agent. And that the agent belongs in that arena. Whatever the agent is, whatever the arena is, because it's probably a bunch of different framings of how you experience that. Yeah, and you do. In your identity as a self, you have all kinds of roles that are somehow contributing to that identity, but are not equivalent to that identity. Yeah. I wonder if like my two hands have different, because there's a different experience of me picking up something with my right hand and then my left hand. Are those like... That's a really cool question, Lex. They certainly feel like their own things, but that could be just anthropomorphization based on cultural narratives and so on. It could, but I think it's a legitimate empirical question because it also could be sort of Ian McGilchrist stuff. It could be you're using different hemispheres and they sort of have different agent arena relationships to the environment. This is a really important question in the cognitive science of the self. Does that hemispheric difference mean you're multiple or you actually have a singular self? So it's important to understand how many cells are there. Yes, I think so. But that's just like a quirk of evolution. Surely it can be fundamental to cognition, having multiple cells or a singular self. It depends, again, because we're getting far from the answer to the question you originally asked me. Do you want me to go back to that first or answer this one? Which question? I already forgot everything. What's the functionality of religion? Yes. Okay. Let us return. Okay. And then we can return to the self. Okay. So you said you have all these propositions and et cetera, et cetera, and they differ from the religions and they don't seem to be considered legitimate by many people. But yet there's something functioning in the religions that is transforming people and making them wiser. And I put it to you that the transformations are largely occurring at those nonpropositional levels. The procedural, the perspectival, and the participatory. And those are the ones, by the way, that are more fundamentally connected to meaning making because remember the propositions are representational and they're dependent on the nonpropositional, nonrepresentational processes of connectedness and relevance realization. So religion goes down deep to the nonpropositional and works there. That's the functionality we need to grasp. Well, you talk about tools, essentially, that humans are able to incorporate into their cognition. Psychotechnologies, like language is one, I suppose. Isn't religion then a psychotechnology? It would be, yeah, an ecology of psychotechnologies, yes. And the question is that Nietzsche ruined everything by saying God is dead. Do we have to invent the new thing? Go from the old phone, create the iPhone, invent the new psychotechnology that takes place of religion. And so when the madman in Nietzsche's text goes into the marketplace, who's he talking to? He's not talking to the believers. He's talking to the atheists and he says, do you not realize what we have done? We have taken a sponge and wiped away the sky. We are now forever falling. We are unchained from the sun. We have to become worthy of this. But Nietzsche is full of romantic bullshit, as we know. No, no, no. No, but there's a point there. Yes. The point is, right, there's one thing to rejecting the proposition. There's another project of replacing the functionality that we lost when we reject the religion. So his worry that as nihilism takes hold, you don't ever replace the thing that religion, the role that religion played in our world. It's hard to tell what he actually, because he's so multivocal. I'll speak for me rather than for Nietzsche. I think it is possible to, using the best cognitive science and respectfully exacting what we can from the best religion and philosophical traditions, because there's things like stoicism that are in the grey line between philosophy and religion, Buddhism is the same. Using that best cocci, that best exaptation, we can come up with that functionality without having to buy into the particular propositional sets of the legacy religions. That's my proposal. I call that the religion that's not a religion. So things like stoicism or modern stoicism, those things, don't you think in some sense they naturally emerge? Don't you think there's a longing for meaning? So stoicism arises during the Hellenistic period when there was a significant meaning crisis in the ancient world because of what had happened after the breakup of Alexander the Great's empire. So if you compare Aristotle to people who are living after Alexander. So Aristotle grows up in a place where everybody speaks the same language, has the same religion, his ancestors have been there for years, he knows everybody. After Alexander the Great's empire is broken up, people are now thousands of miles away from the government, they're surrounded by people because of the diasporas, they're surrounded by people that don't speak their language, don't share their religion, that's why you get all these mother religions emerging, universal mother religions like ISIS, etc. So there is what's called domicile, there's the killing of home, there's a loss of a sense of home and belonging and fittedness during the Hellenistic period and stoicism arose specifically to address that. And because it was designed to address a meaning crisis, it is no coincidence that it is coming back into prominence right now. Well there could be a lot of other variations and it feels like, I think when you speak of the meaning crisis, you're in part describing, not prescribing, you're describing something that is happening. But I would venture to say that if we just leave things be, the meaning crisis dissipates because we long to create institutions, to create collective ideas, so this distributed cognition process that give us meaning. So if religion loses power, we'll find other institutions that are sources of meaning. I don't... Is that your intuition as well? I think we are already doing that. I am involved with and do participant observation of many of these emerging communities that are creating a colleges of practice that are specifically about trying to address the meaning crisis. I just, in late July, went to Washington State and did Rafe Kelly's Evolve Move Play, Return to the Source, and wow, one of the most challenging things I've ever done. That guy is awesome, by the way. I got to interact with him a long, long time ago. He said to say hi to you, by the way. Yeah. It's from another world. It feels like a different world because I interacted with him, not directly, but... This is somebody... He can speak to what he works on, but he makes movement and play... He encourages people to make that a part of their life, like how you move about the world, whether that's as part of sort of athletic endeavors or actual just like walking around a city. And I think the reason I ran into him is because there was a lot of interest in that in the athletic world, in the grappling world, in the Brazilian jiu jitsu world, people who study movement, who make movement part of their lives to see how can we integrate play and fun and just the basic humanness that's natural to our movement. How do we integrate that into our daily practice? So this is yet another way to find meaning. I think it's actually an exemplar of what I was talking about because what's going on with Raif's integration of parkour in nature and martial arts and mindfulness practices and dialogical practices is exactly, and explicitly so by the way, he will tell you he's been very influenced by my work. He's trying to get at the nonpropositional kinds of knowing that make meaning by evolving our sensory motor loop and enhancing our relevance realization because that gives people profound improved sense of connectedness to themselves, to each other and the world. And I'll tell you, Lex, I don't want to say too specifically the final thing that people did because it's part of his secret sauce, right? But what I can say is when it was done, I said to them all, I said, as far as I can tell, none of you are religious, right? And they go, yeah, yeah, and I said, but what you just did was a religious act, wasn't it? And they all went, yeah, it was. Yeah. So that same magic was there. Yes. Bathroom break. Sure. What's your take on atheism in general? Is it closer to truth than, maybe is an atheist closer to truth than a person who believes in God? So I'm a nontheist, which means I think the shared set of presuppositions between the theist and the atheist are actually what needs to be rejected. Can you explain that further? Yes, I can. And I want to point out, by the way, that there are lots of nontheistic religious traditions. So I'm not coming up with a sort of airy fairy category. Yeah. And what's the difference in nontheism, agnosticism and atheism? So nontheists think that the theist and the atheist share a bunch of presuppositions. For example, it's that sacredness is to be understood in terms of a personal being that is, in some sense, the supreme being, and that the right relationship to that being is to have a correct set of beliefs. I reject all of those claims. So both the theist and the atheist see God. In their modern version, yes, yes. In which, do you reject it in the sense that you don't know, or do you reject it in a sense that you believe that each one of those presuppositions is likely to be not true? The latter. Both on reflection, argument, and personal experimentation and experience, I've come to the conclusion that those shared propositions are probably not true. Which one is the most troublesome to you? The personal being, the kind of accumulation of everything into one being that ultimately created stuff? So for me, there's two, and they're interlocked together. I'm not trying to dodge your question. It's that the idea that the ground of being is some kind of being, I think, is a fundamental mistake. It's void of being? No, no, no. The ground of being is some kind of being, so it's turtles all the way down. The ground of being is not itself any kind of being. Being is not a being. It is the ability for things to be, which is not the same thing as a being. Are humans beings? We are beings. This glass is a being. This table is a being. But when I ask you, how are they all in being, you don't say, by being a glass or by being a table or by being a human. You want to say, no, no, there's something underneath it all, and then you realize it can't be any thing. This is why many mystical traditions converge on the idea that the ground of being is no thingness, which is normally pronounced as nothingness. But if you put the hyphen back in, you get the original intent, no thingness. That is bound up with, okay, what I need to do in order to be in relationship with … So, it's a misconstruing of ultimate reality as a supreme being, which is a category mistake to my mind, and then my relationship to it, that sacredness is a function of belief. And I have been presenting you an argument through most of our discussion that meaning is at a deeper level than beliefs and propositions. And so, that is a misunderstanding of sacredness, because I take sacredness to be that which is most meaningful and connected to what is most real. And theists think of sacredness as what? They think of sacredness as a property of a particular being, God, and that the way that is meaningful to them is by asserting a set of propositions or beliefs. Now, I want to point out that this is what I would now call modern or common theism. You go back into the classical periods of Christianity, you get a view that's really radically different from how most people understand theism today. Okay, so let me … This is an interesting question that I usually think about in the form of mathematics, but … So, in that case, if meaning is sacred in your nontheist view, is meaning created or is it discovered? There's a Latin word that doesn't separate them called inventio, and I would say that, and before you say, oh, well, give me a chance, because you participate in it. You've experienced an insight, yes? Did you make it happen? The insight … Did you make it happen or did … Did you do … Like, can you do that? I'm going to have … I need an insight. This is what I do to make an insight. Oh, I see. Yeah, in some sense, it came from elsewhere. Right, but you didn't just passively receive it, either. You're engaged and involved in it. That's why you get … Right? So that's what I mean by you participate in it. You participate in meaning. So you do think that it's both? Yes. You do think it's both? I mean, that's not a trivial thing to understand, because a lot of time we think … When you think about a search for meaning, you think … It's like you're going through a big house and you open each door and look if it's there and so on, as if there is going to be a glowing orb that you discover, but at the same time, I'm somebody that, based on the chemistry of my brain, have been extremely fortunate to be able to discover beauty in everything, in the most mundane and boring of things. I am, as David Foster Wallace said, unboreable. I could just sit in a room, just like playing with a tennis ball or something and be excited, basically like a dog, I think, endlessly. So to me, meaning is created, because I could create meaning out of everything, but of course, it doesn't require a partner. It does require dance partners, whatever, it does require the tennis ball. But honestly, that's what a lot of people that I don't necessarily … We'll talk about it. I don't practice meditation, but people who meditate very seriously, like the entire days for months kind of thing, they talk about being able to discover meaning in just the wind or something, like they just … The breath and everything, just subtle sensory experiences give you deep fulfillment. So that's, again, it's interaction. Actually, I do want to say, because the interesting difference that you've drawn between nontheism, theism and atheism, where's the agreement or disagreement between you and Jordan Peterson on this? I want to say to Jordan about this, because you're very clear, it's kind of beautiful in the clarity in which you lay this out. I wonder if Jordan has arrived at a similar kind of clarity. Have you been able to draw any kind of lines between the way the two of you see religion? Yeah. So there was a video released, I think, like two or three weeks ago with Jordan and myself and Jonathan Paget. Oh, I haven't watched that one yet, yeah. And it's around this question, Lux. He's basically sort of making, he's putting together an argument for God. I mean, I think that's a fair way. I don't think he would object to me saying that. And Jonathan Paget is also a, well, Jonathan is a Christian, it's unclear what Jordan is. And Jonathan's work is on symbolism and different mythologies and Christianity. Yes, especially Neoplatonic Christianity, which is very important. I have a lot of respect, well, I have a lot of respect for both of them, but I have a lot of respect for Jonathan. But in my participation in that dialogue, you could see me, well, repeatedly, but I think everybody, including Jordan, thought constructively challenging sort of the attempt to build a theistic model, and I was challenging it from a nontheistic perspective. So I think we don't agree on certain sets of propositions. But there was a lot of, there was also a lot of acknowledgement, and I think genuine appreciation on his part and Jonathan's part of the arguments I was making. So they believe in maybe the presupposition of like a supreme being. Not believe, but they see the power of that particular presupposition in being a source of meaning. I think that's relatively clear for me with Jordan. Jordan's a really complex guy, so it's very hard to just like pin. To my best sort of understanding, yes, I think that's clearly the case for Jordan. It's not the case for Jonathan. Jonathan is, remember I said I was talking about modern atheism and theism? Jonathan is a guy who somehow went into icon carving and Maximus the Confessor and Eastern Orthodoxy and has come out of it at the other end as a fifth century church father that is nevertheless being, rightfully so, found to be increasingly relevant to many people. So he's deeply old school. Yeah, I think he has, he and I, especially because Neoplatonism is a nontheistic philosophical spirituality and it's a big part of Eastern Orthodoxy, he and I, I think, he would say things like, God doesn't exist. What? You're a Christian, right? And then he's being coy, but he'll say, well, God doesn't exist the way the cup exists or the table exists, the same kind of move I was making a few minutes ago. He'll say things like that. He will emphasize the no thingness of ultimate reality, the no thingness of God, because he's from that version of Christianity, what you might call classical theism, but classical theism looks a lot more like nontheism than it looks like modern theism. That's so interesting. Yeah, that's really interesting. What about, is there a line to be drawn between myth and religion in terms of its usefulness in man's search for meaning? So here's where Jordan and I are in much more, actually all three of us are in significant agreement. I said this in my series, but I want to say it again here. Myths aren't stories about things that happened in the deep past that are largely irrelevant. Myths are stories about perennial or pertinent patterns that need to be brought into awareness. And they need to be brought into an awareness, not just or primarily at the propositional level, but at those nonpropositional levels. And I think that is what good mythos does. I prefer to use the Greek word because we've now turned the English word into a synonym for a widely believed falsehood. And I don't think, again, if you go back even to the church fathers, I'm not a Christian, I'm not advocating for Christianity, but neither am I here to attack it. But when they talk about reading these stories, they think the literal interpretation is the weakest and the least important. You move to the allegorical or the symbolic, to the moral, to the spiritual, the mystical, and that's where... So they would say to you, but how is the story of Adam and Eve true for you now? And I don't mean true for you in that relativistic sense, I mean, how is it pointing to a pattern in your life right now? So there is some sense in which the telling of this mythos becomes real in connecting to the patterns that kind of captivate the public today. Sure. So you just keep telling the story. I mean, there's something about some of these stories that are just really good at being sticky to the patterns of each generation. Yes. And they'll stick to different patterns throughout time, they're just sticky in powerful ways. Yes. And so we keep returning back to them again and again and again. And it's important to see that some of these stories are recursive, they're myths about one particular set of patterns, they're myths about not just the important pattern. You get the Jordan stuff about there's heroes and myths are trying to make us understand the need for being heroic in our own lives. One of the things I like to put in counterbalance to that is the Greek also have myths of hubris, that counterbalance the heroic. But then there are myths that are not about those deeply important patterns, but they're myths about religio itself, that the way we're—religio means to bind, to connect, the way relevance realization connects us. And so the point of the myth is not notice that pattern or notice that pattern or notice that pattern, it's notice how all of these patterns are emerging and what does that say about us and reality. And those myths, those myths, I think, are genuinely profound. And how much of the myths, how much of the power of those myths is about the dialogues? You talk about this quite a bit, I think in the first conversation with Jordan, you guys, I'm not sure you've gotten really into it, you scratched the surface a little bit. But the role of, as you say, dialogue in distributed cognition. What is that? The thing we're doing right now, talking with our mouth holes, what is that? And actually, can I ask you this question? If aliens came to Earth and were observing humans, would they notice our distributed cognition first or our individual cognition first? What is the most notable thing about us humans? Is it our ability to individually do well on IQ tests or whatever? Or puzzle solve, or is it this thing we're doing together? I think most of our problem solving is done in distributed cognition. Look around, you didn't make this equipment, you didn't build this place, you didn't invent this language that we're both sharing, et cetera, et cetera. And now there's more specific and precise experimental evidence coming out. Let's take a standard task that people, reasoning task, I won't need to do the details, it's called the waste and selection task. And you give it to people, highly educated psychology students, premier universities across the world, we've been doing it since the 60s, it replicates and replicates, and only 10% of the people get it right. You put them in a group of four, and you allow them to talk to each other, the success rate goes to 80%. That's just one example of a phenomenon that's coming to the fore. By the way, do you know if a similar experiment has been done on a group of engineering students versus psychology students? Is there a major group differences in IQ between those two? Just kidding. Let's move on. All right, so there is a lot of evidence that there's power to this distributed cognition. Now what about this mechanism, this fascinating mechanism of the ants interacting with each other? The dialogue. I use the word discourse or dialogue for just people having a conversation, and this is deeply inspired by Socrates and Plato, especially the Platonic dialogues. And I'm sure we've all had this, and so give me a moment because I want to build onto something here. We've participated in conversations that took on a life of their own and took us both in directions we did not anticipate, afforded us insights that we could not have had on our own. And we don't have to have come to an agreement, but we were both moved and we were both drawn into insight, and we feel like, wow, that was one of the best moments of my life because we feel how that introduced us to a capacity for tapping into a flow state within distributed cognition that puts us into a deeper relationship with ourselves, with another person, and potentially with the world. That's what I mean by dialogos. And so for me, I think dialogos is more important... Boy, I could just... I'm sorry, I can hear Jordan and Jonathan in my head right now, but I think it's more... I hear them all the time. I just wish they would shut up in my head sometimes. So what are they saying to you in your head? What they're saying... Well, see, that's what the most recent conversation was about. I was trying to say that I don't think mythos is... I think mythos is really important. I think these kinds of narratives are really important, but I think this ability to connect together in distributed cognition, collective intelligence, and cultivate a shared flow state within that collective intelligence so it starts to ramp up perhaps towards collective wisdom. I think that's more important because I think that's the basin within which the myths and the rituals are ultimately created and when they function. A myth is like a public dream. It depends on distributed cognition, and it depends on people enacting it and getting into mutual flow states. So the highest form of dialogos of conversation is this flow state, and that it forms the foundation for myth building. I think so. I think so. So that communitas, that's Victor Turner's phrase, and he specifically linked it to flow, and I study flow scientifically, that within distributed cognition as the home, as the generator of mythos and ritual, and those are bound together as well, I think that's fundamentally correct. You know what's the cool thing here, because I'm a huge fan of podcasts and audiobooks, but podcasts in particular is relevant here, is there's a third person in this room listening now, and they're also in the flow state. Yes, yes. Like I'm close friends with a lot of podcasts, they don't know I exist. I just listen to them because I've been in so many flow states with them, and I was like, yes, yes, this is good. But they don't know I exist, but they are in conversation with me, ultimately. And think of what that's doing. You've got dialogues, and then you've got this meta dialogue like you're describing, and think about how things like podcasts and YouTube, they break down old boundaries between the private and the public, between writing and oral speech. So we have the dynamics of living oral speech, but it has the permanency of writing. We're in the midst of creating a vehicle and a medium for distributed cognition that breaks down a lot of the categories by which we organized our cognition. Because of the tools of YouTube and so on, just the network, the graph of how quickly the distributed cognition can spread is really powerful. Just a huge amount of people have listened to your lectures, I've listened to your lectures, but I've experienced them, at least in your style, there's something about your style, it felt like a conversation. It felt like at any moment I could interrupt you and say something, and I was just listening. Thank you for saying that, because I aspire to being genuinely as Socratic as I can when I'm doing this. Yeah, there was that sentence, actually, as I'm saying it now, why was that? It didn't feel like sometimes lectures are kind of, you know, you come down with the commandments and you just want to listen, but there was a sense like, I mean, I think it was the excitement that you have, like, you have to understand, and also the fact that you were kind of, I think, thinking off the top of your head sometimes, there was a, you were interrupting yourself with thoughts, you were playing with thoughts, like you're reasoning through things often, like you had, you referenced a lot of books, so surely you were extremely well prepared and you were referencing a lot of ideas, but then you were also struggling in the way to present those ideas. Yes, there was, and so the jazz, like the jazz and getting into the flow state and trying to share in a participatory and perspectival fashion the learning with the people rather than just pronouncing at them, yes. What's mindfulness? So published on that as well. And I practice, I've been practicing many forms of mindfulness and ecology of practices since 1991, so I both have practitioner's knowledge and I also study it scientifically. of agency and even a kind of intelligence, kind of sense making ability. But I do not think that we can attribute consciousness, at least what we mean by consciousness, this kind of self awareness, this ability to introspect, et cetera, et cetera, to bacteria. Now the reason why distributed cognition doesn't have consciousness, I think is a little bit more tricky. And I think there's no reason in principle why there couldn't be a consciousness for distributed cognition, collective intelligence. In fact, many, you know, philosophers would agree with me on that point. I think it's more an issue of certain empirical facts, bandwidth, density of connection, speed of information transfer, et cetera. It's conceivable that if we got some horrible Frankensteinian neural link and we linked our brains and we had the right density and dynamics and bandwidth and speed that a group consciousness could take shape. I don't have any argument in principle against that. I'm just saying those contingent facts do not yet exist, and therefore it is implausible that consciousness exists at the level of collective intelligence. So you talk about consciousness quite a bit. So let's step back and try to sneak up to a definition. What is consciousness? For me, there are two aspects to answering that question. One is, what's the nature of consciousness? How does something like consciousness exist in an otherwise apparently nonconscious universe? And then there's a function question, which is equally important, which is, what does consciousness do? The first one is obviously, you know, problematic for most people, like, yeah, consciousness seems to be so different from the rest of the nonconscious universe. But I put it to you that the function question is also very hard, because you are clearly capable of very sophisticated, intelligent behavior without consciousness. You are turning the noises coming out of my face hole into ideas in your mind, and you have no conscious awareness of how that process is occurring. So why do we have consciousness at all? Now, here's the thing. There's an extra question you need to ask. Should we attempt to answer those questions separately, or should we attempt to answer them in an integrated fashion? I make the case that you actually have to answer them in an integrated fashion. What consciousness does, and what it is, we should be able to give it a unified answer to both of those. Can you try to elucidate the difference between what consciousness is and what it does, both of which are mysteries, as you say, state versus action? Can you try to explain the difference that's interesting, that's useful, that's important to understand? So that's putting me in a bit of a difficult position, because I actually argue that trying to answer them separately is ultimately incoherent. But what I can point to are many published articles in which only one of these problems is addressed, and the other is left unaddressed. So people will try and explain what qualia are, how they potentially emerge, without saying what do they do, what problems do they help to solve, how do they make the organism more adaptive. And then you'll have other people who will say, no, no, this is what the function of consciousness is, but I don't know, I can't tell you, I can't solve the hard problem, I don't know how qualia exist. So what I'm saying is many people treat these problems separately, although I think that's ultimately an incoherent way to approach the problem. So the hard problem is focusing on what it is. Yes. So the qualia, that it feels like something to experience a thing, that's what consciousness is. And does is more about the functional usefulness of the thing, to the whole beautiful mix of cognition and just function in everyday life. Okay, you've also said that you can do very intelligent things without consciousness. Yes, clearly. Is that obvious to you? Yes. I don't know what I'm doing to access my memory. It just comes up, and it comes up really intelligently. But the mechanisms that create consciousness could be deeply interlinked with whatever is doing the memory access, that's doing the... Oh, I think so, in fact, yes, yes. So I guess what I'm trying to say in this will probably sneak up to this question a few times, which is whether we can build machines that are conscious, or machines that are intelligent, one level intelligent or beyond, without building the consciousness. I mean, ultimately, that's one of the ways to understand what consciousness is, is to build the thing. We can either sort of from the Chomsky way, try to construct models, like he thinks about language in this way, try to construct models and theories of how the thing works, or we can just build the damn thing. Exactly. And that's a methodological principle in cognitive science. In fact, one of the things that sort of distinguishes cognitive science from other disciplines dealing with the nature of cognition in the mind is that cognitive science takes the design stance. It asks, well, could we build a machine that would not only simulate it, but serve as a bona fide explanation of the phenomenon? Do you find any efforts in cognitive science compelling in this direction? In terms of how far we are, there's, on the computational side of things, something called cognitive modeling, there's all these kinds of packages that you can construct simplified models of how the brain does things and see if complex behaviors emerge. Do you find any efforts in cognitive, or what efforts in cognitive science do you find most inspiring and productive? I think the project of trying to create AGI, artificial general intelligence, is where I place my hope of artificial intelligence being of scientific significance. This is independent of technological socioeconomic significance, which is already well established. But being able to say because of the work in AI, we now have a good theory of cognition, intelligence, perhaps consciousness, I think that's where I place my bets is in the current endeavors around artificial general intelligence. And so tackling that problem head on, which has now become central, at least to a group of cognitive scientists, is I think what needs to be done. And when you think about AGI, do you think about systems that have consciousness? Let's go back to what I think is at the core of your general intelligence. So right now, compared to even our best machines, you are a general problem solver. You can solve a wide variety of problems in a wide variety of domains. And some of our best machines have a little bit of transfer. They can learn this game and play a few other well designed rule bound games, but they couldn't learn how to swim, etc., things like that. And so what's interesting is what seems to come up, and this is some of my published work, in all these different domains of cognition across all these different problem types is a central problem. And since we do have good sort of psychometric evidence that we do have some general ability that's a significant component of our intelligence, I made an argument as to what I think that general ability is. And so it's happening right now. The amount of information in this room that you could actually pay attention to is combinatorial explosive. The amount of information you have in your memory, long term memory, and all the ways you could combine it, combinatorial explosive. The number of possibilities you can consider, also combinatorial explosive. The sequences of behavior you can generate, also combinatorial explosive. And yet somehow you're zeroing in. The right memories are coming up, the right possibilities are opening up, the right sequences of behavior, you're paying attention to the right thing. Not infallibly so, but so much so that you reliably find obvious what you should interact with in order to solve the problem at hand. That's an ability that is still not well understood within AGI. To filtering out the gigantic waterfall of data. Right. It's almost like a Zen Koan. What makes you intelligent is your ability to ignore so much information and do it in such a way that is somewhere between arbitrary guessing and algorithmic search. And to a fault sometimes of course that you, based on the models you construct, you forget, I think, I'm pretty sure I was the first person to academically talk about mindfulness at the University of Toronto within a classroom setting, like lecturing on it. So this is a topic that a lot of people have recently become very interested in, think about, so from that, from the early days, how do you think about what it is? I've critiqued the sort of standard definitions, being aware of the present moment without judgment and because I think they're flawed, and if you want to get into the detail of why we can, but this is how I want to explain it to you, and it also points to the fact of why you need an ecology of mindfulness practices. You shouldn't equate mindfulness with meditation. I think that's a primary mistake. When you say ecology, what do you mean, by the way? So lots of many different variants? No, so what I mean by ecology is exactly what you have in an ecology. You have a dynamical system in which there are checks and balances on each other, right? And I'll get to that with this about mindfulness, so I'll make that connection if you allow me. So we're always framing, we've been talking about that, right? And for those of you who are not on YouTube, this podcast, I wear glasses and I'm now sort of putting my fingers and thumb around the frames of my glasses. So this is my frame, and my lens is, right, and that frame, the frame holds a lens, and I'm seeing through it in both senses, beyond and by means of it. So right now, my glasses are transparent to me. I want to use that as a strong analogy for my mental framing, okay? Now this is what you do in meditation, I would argue. You step back from looking through your frame and you look at it, I'm taking my glasses off right now and I'm looking at them. Why might I do that? To see if there's something in the lenses that is distorting, causing me to, right? Now if I just did that, that could be helpful, but how do I know if I've actually corrected the change I made to my lenses? What do I need to do? I need to put my glasses on and see if I can now see more clearly and deeply than I could before. Meditation is this, stepping back and looking at. Contemplation is that looking through, and there are different kinds of practices. The fact that we treat them as synonyms is a deep mistake. The word contemplation has temple in it, in Latin contemplatio, means to look up to the sky. It's a translation of the Greek word theoria, which we get our word theory from. It's to look deeply into things. Meditation is more about having to do with reflecting upon, standing back and looking at. Mindfulness includes both. It includes your ability to break away from an inappropriate frame and the ability to make a new frame. That's what actually happens in insight. You have to both break an inappropriate frame and make, see, realize a new frame. This is why mindfulness enhances insight. Both ways, by the way, meditative practices and also contemplative practices. So mindfulness is frame awareness that can be appropriated in order to improve your capacities for insight and self regulation. Now I am inexperienced with meditation, the rigorous practice and the science of meditation, but I've talked to people who seriously as a science study psychedelics and they often talk about the really important thing is the sort of the integration back. So the contemplation step. So if you, it's not just the actual things you see on psychedelics or the actual journey of where your mind goes on psychedelics. It's also the integrating that into the new perspective that you take on life. Right. Exactly. You really nicely described. So meditation is the, in that metaphors is the psychedelic journey to a different mind state and then contemplation is the return back to reality, how you integrate that into a new world view and mindfulness is the whole process. Right. So if you just did contemplation, you could suffer from inflation and projective fantasy. If you just do meditation, you can suffer from withdrawal, spiritual bypassing, avoiding reality. They act, they need each other. You have to cycle between them. It's like what I talked about earlier, when I talked about the opponent processing within the autonomic nervous system or the opponent processing at work and attention. And that's what I mean by an ecology of practices. You need both. Neither one is a panacea. You need them in this opponent processing, acting as checks and balance on each other. Is there sort of practical advice you can give to people on how to meditate or how to be mindful in this full way? Yes. I would tell them to do at least three things. And I was, I lucked into this. When I started meditation, I went down the street and there was a place that taught Vipassana meditation, Metta contemplation and Tai Chi Chuan for flow induction. And you should get, you should have a meditative practice, you should find a contemplative practice and you should find a moving mindfulness practice, especially one that is conducive to the flow state and practice them in an integrated fashion. Can you elaborate what those practices might look like? So generally speaking. Meditative practice like Vipassana. So what's the primary thing I look through rather than look at? It's my sensations. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to focus on my sensations rather than focusing on the world through my sensations. So I'm going to follow, for example, the sensations in this area of my abdomen where my breathing is. So I can feel as my abdomen is expanding, I can feel those sensations and then I can feel the sensations as it's contracting. Now what will happen is my mind will leap back to try to look through and look at the world again. Right? I'll start thinking about, I need to do my laundry or what was that noise? And so what do I do? I don't get involved with the content. I step back and label the process with an ING word, listening, imagining, planning. And then I return my attention to the breath and I have to return my attention in the correct way. So part of your mind that jumps around in the Buddhist tradition, this is called your monkey mind. It's like a monkey leaping for branches and chattering, right? If I was trying to train that monkey mind to stay, or as Jack Kornfield said, train a puppy dog, stay puppy dog, and if it goes and I get really angry and I bring it back and I'm yelling at it, I'm going to train it to fight and fear me. But if I just indulge it, if I just feed its whims, oh, look, the puppy dog went there. Oh, now it's there. Puppy dog never learns to stay. What do I need to do? I have to neither fight it nor feed it. I have to have this centered attitude. I have to befriend it. So you step back and look at your sensations. You step back and look at your distracting processes. You return your attention to the breath and you do it with the right attitude. That's the core of a good meditative practice. Okay. Then what's a good contemplative practice? A good contemplative practice is to try and meta, it's actually apropos because we talked about that participatory knowing the way you're situated in the world. So this is a long thing because there's different interpretations of meta and I go for what's called an existential interpretation over an emotional one. So what I'm doing in meta is I'm trying to awaken in two ways. I'm trying to awaken to the fact that I am constantly assuming an identity and assigning an identity. So I'm looking at that. I'm trying to awaken to that and then I'm trying to awake from the modal confusion that I could get into around that. And so I'm looking out onto the world and I'm trying to see you in a fundamentally different way than I have before. You know, like you go to the gym and you do bicep curls. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Is it possible to reduce it to those things that, I mean, you don't need to speak to the specifics, but is there actual practice you can do or is it really personal? No, I teach people how to do the meta practice. I also teach them how to do a Neoplatonic contemplative practice, how to do a Stoic. Another one you can do is the view from above. This is classic Stoicism. I get you to imagine that you're in this room and then imagine that you're floating above the room, then above Austin, then above Texas, then above the United States, then the earth. And you have to really imagine it. Don't just think it, but really imagine. And then what you notice is as you're pulling out to a wider and wider like contemplation of reality, your sense of self and what you find relevant and important also changes. No, for all of these, there is a specific step by step methodology. Oh, so you can, so like in that one, you could just literally imagine yourself floating farther and farther out. But you have to go through the steps because the stepping matters because if you just jump, it doesn't work. Do you have any of this stuff online by the way? I do because during COVID, I decided at the advice of a good friend to do a daily course. I taught meditating with John Vervecki. I did all the way through meditation, contemplation, even some of the movement practices. That's all there. It's all available. That was largely inspired by Buddhism and Taoism. And then I went into the Western tradition and went through things like Stoicism and Neoplatonism, cultivating wisdom with John Vervecki. That's all there, all free. On your website? Yeah. It's on my YouTube channel. Yeah. On your YouTube channel. Okay. That's exciting. I mean, your Meaning Crisis lectures is just incredible. Everything around it, including the notes and the notes that people took, it's just, it created this tree of conversations. It's really, really, really well done. What about flow induction? You want to flow wisely. And first of all, you need to understand what flow is, and then you need to confront a particular issue around, a practical problem around flow. Let's go there because a lot of those words seem like synonyms to people sometimes. So the state of flow, what is it? All right. So, and he just died last year, Csikszentmihalyi. I admire him very much. We've exchanged a bunch of messages over the past few years, and he wanted to do the podcast several times. Oh, that would have been wonderful. But he said he struggled with his health, and I never knew in those situations, I deeply regret several cases like this that I had with Conway, that I should have pushed him on it because, yeah, as you get later in life, things, the simple things become more difficult, but a voice, especially one that hasn't been really heard, is important to hear. So anyway, I apologize, but yeah. No, no. I share that. I mean, I can tell you that within my area, he is important and he's famous in an academics sense. Yeah. So the flow state, two important sets of conditions, and very often people only talk about one, and that's a little bit of a misrepresentation. So the flow state is in situations in which the demand of the situation is slightly beyond your skills. So you both have to apply all the skills you can with as much sort of attention and concentration as you possibly can, and you have to actually be stretching your skills. Now, in this circumstance, people report optimal experience, optimal in two ways. Optimal in that this is one of the best experiences I've had in my life. It's distinct from pleasure, and yet it explains why people do very bizarre things like rock climbing because it's a good flow induction. But they also mean optimal in a second sense, my best performance. So it's both the best experience and the best performance. So Csikszentmihalyi also talked about the information flow conditions you need, right, in order for there to be this state of flow, and then I'll talk about what it's like to be in flow in a sec. What you need is three things. You need the information that you're getting to be clear. It can't be ambiguous or vague. Think about a rock climber. If it's ambiguous and vague, you're in trouble, right? There has to be tightly coupled feedback between what you do and how the environment responds. So when you act, there's an immediate response. There isn't a big time lag between your action and your ability to detect the response from the environment. Third, failure has to matter. Error really matters. So there should be some anxiety about failure. And failure matters. So that, yeah, because… Like to you, the person that participates. Yes, yes, yes. Now when you're in the flow state, notice how this sits on the boundary between the secular and the sacred. When you're in the flow state, people report a tremendous sense of atonement with the environment. They report a loss of a particular kind of self consciousness, that narrative, nurturing nanny in your head that, how do I look? Do people like me? How do I look? How's my hair? Do people like me? Should I have said that? That all goes away. You're free from that. You're free from the most sadistic, superego self critic you could possibly have, at least for a while. The world is vivid. It's super salient to you. There's an ongoing sense of discovery. Although often you know you're exerting a lot of metabolic effort, it feels effortless. So in the flow state when you're sparring, your hand just goes up for the block and your strike just goes through the empty space. Or if you're a goalie in hockey, I've got to mention hockey once, I'm a Canadian, right? You put out your glove hand and the puck's there, right? So there's this tremendous sense of grace, atonement, super salience, discovery and realness. People don't, when they're in the flow state, they don't go, I bet this is an illusion. The interesting question for me and my coauthors in the article we published in the Oxford Handbook of Spontaneous Thought with Arianne Harabennett and Leo Ferraro is that's a descriptive account of flow. We wanted an explanatory account, one of the causal mechanisms at work in flow. And so we actually proposed to interlocking cognitive processes. The first thing we said is, well, what's going on in flow? Well think about it. Think about the rock climber. The rock climber, and I talked about this earlier, they're constantly restructuring how they're seeing the rock face. They're constantly doing something like insight, and if they fail to do it, they impasse and that starts to get dangerous. So they've got to do an insight that primes an insight that primes an insight. So imagine the aha experience, that flash and that moment, and imagine it cascading so you're getting the extended aha. That's why things are super salient. There's a sense of discovery. There's a sense of atonement, of deep participation, of grace, but there's something else going on too. So there's a phenomenon called implicit learning, also very well replicated. It's way back in the 60s with Rieber. You can give people complex patterns, like number and letter strings, and they can learn about those patterns outside of deliberate focal awareness. That's what's called implicit learning. And what's interesting is if you try and change that task into, tell me the pattern, but explicitly try to figure it out, the performance degrades. So here's the idea. You have this adaptive capacity for implicit learning, and what it does is it results in you being able to track complex variables in a way, but you don't know how you came up with that knowledge. And this is Hogarth's proposal in educating intuition. Intuition is actually the result of implicit learning. So an example I use is how far do you stand away from somebody at a funeral? There's a lot of complex variables. There's status, closeness to the person, your relationship to them, past history, all kinds of stuff, and yet you know how to do it, and you didn't have to go to funeral school. I'm just using that as an example. So you have these powerful intuitions. Now here's Hogarth's great point. Implicit learning, remember I said before, the things that make it adaptive make us subject to self deception? Here's another example. Implicit learning is powerful at picking up on complex patterns, but it doesn't care what kind of pattern it is. It doesn't distinguish causal patterns from merely correlational patterns. So implicit learning, when we like it, it's intuition. When it's picking up on stuff that's bogus, we call it prejudice or all kinds of other names for intuition that's going wrong. Now, he said, okay, what do we do? What do we do about this? And this will get back to Flo. What do we do about this? Well, we can't try to replace implicit learning with explicit learning because we'll lose all the adaptiveness to it. So what can we do explicitly? What we can do is take care of the environment in which we're doing the implicit learning. How do we do that? We try to make sure the environment has features that help us distinguish causation from correlation. What kind of environments have we created that are good at distinguishing causation from correlation? Experimental environments. What do you do in an experiment? You make sure that the variables are clear, no confound, no ambiguity, no vagueness. You make sure there's a tight coupling between the independent and the dependent variable and your hypothesis can be falsified. Error matters. Now look at those three, Lex. Those are exactly the three conditions that you need for Flo. Clear information, tightly coupled feedback and error matters. So Flo is not only an insight cascade, improving your insight capacity, it's also a marker that you're cultivating the best kind of intuitions, the ones that fit you best to the causal patterns in your environment. But it's hard to achieve that kind of environment where there's a clear distinction between causality and correlation and it has the rigor of a scientific experiment. Fair enough and I don't think Hogarth was saying it's gonna be epistemically as rigorous as a scientific experiment, but he's saying if you structure that, it will tend to do what that scientific method does, which is find causal... Think of the rock climber. All of those things are the case. They need clear information. It's tightly coupled and error matters and they think what they're doing is very real because if they're not conforming to the real causal patterns of the rock face and the physiology of their body, they will fall. Is there something to be said about the power of discovering meaning and having this deep relationship with the moment? There's something about flow that really forgets the past and the future and is really focused on the moment. I think that's part of the phenomenology, but I think the functionality has to do with the fact that what's happening in flow is that dynamic nonpropositional connectedness that is so central to meaning is being optimized. This is why flow is a good predictor of how well you rate your life, how much well being you think you have, which of course is itself also predictive and interrelated with how meaningful you find your life. One of the things that you can do, but there's an important caveat, to increase your sense of meaning in life is to get into the flow state more frequently. That's why I said you want a moving practice that's conducive to the flow state, but there's one important caveat, which is we of course have figured out and I'm playing with words here how to game this and how to hijack it by creating things like video games. I'm not saying this is the case for all video games or this is the case for all people, but the WHO now acknowledges this as a real thing that you can get into the flow state within the video game world to the detriment of your ability to get into the flow state in the real world. What's the opposite of flow? Depression. In fact, depression has been called anti flow. So you get these people that are flowing in this non real world and they can't transfer it to the real world and it's actually costing them flow in the real world. So they tend to get, they tend to suffer depression and all kinds of things. Your ability, your habit and just skill at attaining flow in the video game world basically makes you less effective or maybe shocks you at how difficult it is to achieve flow in the physical world. Yeah. I'm not sure about that. I just, I don't want to push back against the implied challenge of transferability because there's a lot of, I have a lot of friends that play video games, a very large percent of young folks play video games and I'm hesitant to build up models of how that affects behavior. My intuition is weak there. Sometimes people that have PhDs are of a certain age that they came up when video games weren't a deep part of their life development. I would venture to say people who have developed their brain with video games being a part, a large part of that world are in some sense different humans and it's possible that they can transfer more effectively. Some of the lessons, some of the ability to attain flow from the virtual world to the physical world, they're also more, I would venture to say, resilient to the negative effects of, for example, social media or video games that have maybe the objectification or the over sexualized or violent aspect of video games. They're able to turn that off when they go to the physical world and turn it back on when they're playing the video games probably more effectively than the old timers. So I just want to say this sort of, I'm not sure, it's a really interesting question how transferable the flow state is. I don't know if you want to comment on that. I do, I do. First of all, I did qualify and I'm saying it's not the case for all video games or for all people. I'm holding out the possibility and I know this possibility because I've had students who actually suffer from this and have done work around it with me. The ability to achieve. They couldn't transfer, yeah. And then they were able to step back from that and then take up the cognitive science and write about it and work on it. Also, I'm not so sure about the resiliency claim because there seems to be mounting evidence. It's not consensus, but it's certainly not regarded as fringe, that the increase in social media is pretty strongly correlated with increase in depression, self destructive behavior, things like this. I would like to see that evidence. Sure. I can find it. No, no, no. Let me, I'm always hesitant to too eagerly kind of agree with things that I want to agree with. There's a public perception everyone seems to hate on social media. I wonder, as always with these things, does it reveal depression or does it create depression? This is always the question. It's like whenever you talk about any political or ideological movement, does it create hate or does it reveal hate? And that's a good thing to ask and you should always challenge the things that you intuitively want to believe. I agree with that. Like aliens. So one of the ways you address this, and it's not sufficient and I did say the work is preliminary, but if I can give you a plausible mechanism that's new and then that lends credence. And part of what happens is illusory social comparison. Think of Instagram. People are posting things that are not accurate representation of their life or life events. In fact, they will stage things, but the people that are looking at these, they take it often as real and so they get downward social comparison and this is like compared to how you and I probably live where we may get one or two of those events a week, they're getting them moment by moment. And so it's a plausible mechanism that why it might be driving people into a more depressed state. Okay, the flip side of that is because there's a greater, greater gap going from real world to Instagram world, you start to be able to laugh at it and realize that it's artificial. So for example, even just artificial filters, people start to realize like, there's like, it's the same kind of gap as there is between the video game world and the real world. In the video game world, you can do all kinds of wild things. Grand theft auto, you can shoot people up, you can do whatever the heck you want. In the real world, you can't and you start to develop an understanding of how to have fun in the virtual world and in the physical world. And I think it's just as a pushback, I'm not saying either is true though, those are very interesting claims. The more ridiculously out of touch Instagram becomes, the easier you can laugh it off potentially in terms of the effect it has on your psyche. I'll respond to that. But at some point, we should get back to Flo. As we engage in Flo. You laugh at the shampoo commercial and you buy the shampoo. There's a capacity for tremendous bullshitting because of the way these machines are designed to trigger salience without triggering reflective truth seeking. I'm thinking of common examples because sometimes you can laugh all the way to the bank. You can laugh and not buy the shampoo. There's many cases, so I think you have to laugh hard enough. You do have to laugh hard enough, but the advertisers get millions of dollars precisely because for many, many people, it does make you buy the shampoo and that's the concern. And maybe the machine of social media is such that it optimizes the shampoo buying. Yes. The point I was trying to make is whether or not that particular example is ultimately right, the possibility of transfer failure is a real thing. And I want to contrast that to an experience I had when I was in grad school. I had been doing Tai Chi Chuan about three or four years, very religiously, both senses of the word, like three or four hours a day and reading all the literature and I was having all the weird experiences, cold as ice, hot as lava, all that stuff and it's ooh, right? But my friends in grad school, they said to me, what's going on? You're different. And I said, what do you mean? And they said, well, you're a lot more balanced in your interactions and you're a lot more flowing and you're a lot more sort of flexible and you adjust more and I realized, oh, and this was the sort of Taoist claim around Tai Chi Chuan that it actually transfers in ways that you might not expect. You start to be able, and I've now noticed that, I now notice how I'm doing Tai Chi even in this interaction and how it can facilitate and afford and so there's a powerful transfer and that's what I meant by flow wisely, not only flow in a way that's making sure that you're distinguishing causation from correlation, which flow can do, but find how to situate it, home it so that it will percolate through your psyche and permeate through many domains of your life. Is there something you could say similar to our discussion about mindfulness and meditation and contemplation about the world that psychedelics take our mind? Where does the mind go when it's on psychedelics? I want to remind you of something you said, which is a gem. It's not so much the experience, but the degree to which it can be integrated back. So here's a proposal that comes from Woodward and others, a lot of convergence around this. Carhartt Harris is talking about it similarly in the entropic brain, but I'm not going to talk first about psychedelics. I'm going to talk about neural networks and I'm going to talk about a classic problem in neural networks. So neural networks, like us with intuition and implicit learning, are fantastic at picking up on complex patterns. Which neural networks are we talking about? I'm talking about a general, just general... Both artificial and biological? Yes. Yes. I think at this point, there is no relevant difference. So one of the classic problems because of their power is they suffer from overfitting to the data, or for those of you who are in a statistical orientation, they pick up patterns in the sample that aren't actually present in the population. And so what you do is there's various strategies. You can do dropout where you periodically turn off half of the nodes in a network. You can drop noise into the network. And what that does is it prevents overfitting to the data and allows the network to generalize more powerfully to the environment. I proposed to you that that's basically what psychedelics do. They do that. They basically do significant constraint reduction. And so you get areas of the brain talking to each other that don't normally talk to each other, areas that do talk to each other, not talking to each other, down regulation of areas that are very dominant, like the default mode network, et cetera. And what that does is exactly something strongly analogous to what's happening in dropout or putting noise into the data. It opens up. And by the way, if you give human beings an insight problem that they're trying to solve and you throw in some noise, like literally static on the screen, you can trigger an insight in them. So like literally very simplistic kind of noise to the perception system. Right. It can break it out of overfitting to the data and open you up. Now, that means, though, that just doing that in and of itself is not the answer because you also have to make sure that the system can go back to exploring that new space properly. This isn't a problem with neural networks. You turn off dropout and they just go back to being powerful neural networks, and now they explore the state space that they couldn't explore before. Human beings are a little bit more messy around this, and this is where the analogy does get a little bit strained. So they need practices that help them integrate that opening up to the new state space so they can properly integrate it. So beyond Leary's state and setting, I think you need another S. I think you need sacred. You need, psychedelics need to be practiced within a sapiential framework, a framework in which people are independently and beforehand improving their abilities to deal with self deception and afford insight and self regulate. This is, of course, the overwhelming way in which psychedelics are used by indigenous cultures. And I think if we put them into that context, then they can help the project of people self transcending, cultivating meaning and increasing wisdom. But if I think we remove them out of that context and put them in the context of commodities taken just to have certain phenomenological changes, we run certain important risks. So using the term of higher states of consciousness. Yes. Is consciousness an important part of that word? Why higher? Is it a higher state or is it a detour, a side road on the main road of consciousness? Where do we go here? I think the psychedelic state is on a continuum. There's insight and then flow is an insight cascade. There's flow and then you can have sort of psychedelic experiences, mind revealing experiences, but they overlap with mystical experiences and they aren't the same. So for example, in the Griffiths lab, they gave people psilocybin and they taught them ahead of time sort of the features of a mystical experience and only a certain proportion of the people that took the psilocybin went from a psychedelic into a mystical experience. What was interesting is the people that had the mystical experience had measurable and longstanding change to one of the big five factors of personality. They had increased openness, openness is supposed to actually go down over time and these traits aren't supposed to be that malleable and it was significantly like altered, right? But imagine if you just created more openness in a person, right? And they're now open to a lot more and they want to explore a lot more, but you don't give them the tools of discernment. That could be problematic for them in important ways. That could be very problematic. Yes, I got it, but you know, so you have to land the plane in a productive way somehow integrated back into your life and how you see the world and how you frame your perception of that world. And when people do that, that's when I call it a transformative experience. Now the higher states of consciousness are really interesting because they tend to move people from a mystical experience into a transformative experience, because what happens in these experiences is something really, really interesting. They get to a state that's ineffable, they can't put it into words, they can't describe it, but they're in this state temporarily and then they come back and they do this. They say, that was really real and this in comparison is less real. So I remember that platonic meta desire, I want to change my life myself so that I'm more in conformity with that really real, and that is really odd, Lex, because normally when we go outside of our consensus intelligibility, like a dream state, we come back from it, we say, that doesn't fit into everything, therefore it's unreal. They do the exact opposite. They come out of these states and they say, that doesn't fit into this consensus intelligibility and that means this is less real. They do the exact opposite and that fascinates me. Why do they flip our normal procedure about evaluating alternative states? The thing is those higher states of consciousness, precisely because they have that ontonormativity, the realness that demands that you make a change in your life, they serve to bridge between mystical experiences and genuine transformative experiences. So you do think seeing those as more real is productive because then you reach for them. So Jaden's done work on it, and again, all of this stuff isn't recent, so we have to take it with a grain of salt, but by a lot of objective measure, people who do this, who have these higher states of consciousness and undertake the transformative process, their lives get better, their relationships improve, their sense of self improves, their anxieties go down, depression, like all of these other measures, the needles are moved on these measures by people undergoing this transformative experience. Their lives, by many of the criteria that we judge our lives to be good, get better. I have to ask you about this fascinating distributed cognition process that leads to mass formation of ideologies that have had an impact on our world. So you spoke about the clash of the two great pseudo religious ideologies of Marxism and Nazism. Yes. Especially their clash on the Eastern Front. Battle of Kursk. Can you explain the origin of each of these, Marxism and Nazism, in a kind of way that we have been talking about the formation of ideas? Hegel is to Protestantism what Thomas Aquinas is to Catholicism. He was the philosopher who took German Protestantism and also Kant and Fichte and Schelling, and he built a philosophical system. He explicitly said this, by the way. He wanted to bridge between philosophy and religion. He explicitly said that. I'm not foisting that on him. He said it repeatedly in many different places. So he's trying to create a philosophical system that gathered to it, I think, the core mythos of Christianity. The core mythos of Christianity is this idea of a narrative structure to reality in which progress is real, in which our actions now can change the future. We can co participate with God in the creation of the future, and that future can be better. It can reach something like a utopia or the promised land or whatever. He created a philosophical system of brilliance, by the way. He's a genius. But basically what it did was it took that religious vision and gave it the air of philosophical intelligibility and respect. And then Marx takes that and says, you know that process by which the narrative is working itself out that Hegel called dialectic, I don't think it's primarily happening in ideas. I think it's happening primarily between classes within socioeconomic factors. But it's the same story. Here's this mechanism of history, it's teleological, it's going to move this way, it can move towards a utopia. We can either participate in furthering it, like participating in the work of God, or we can thwart it and be against it. And so you have a pseudo religious vision. It's all encompassing. Think about how Marxism is not just a philosophical position, it's not just an economic position. It's an entire worldview, an entire account of history, and a demanding account of what human excellence is. And it has all these things about participating, belonging, fitting to. But it's very, in Marx's case, it's very pragmatic or directly applicable to society, to where it leads to, it more naturally leads to political ideologies. It does. But I think Marx, to a very significant degree, inherits one of Hegel's main flaws. Hegel is talking about all this and he's trying to fit it into post Kantian philosophy. So for him, it's ultimately propositional, conceptual. He like everybody after Descartes is very focused on the propositional level, and he's not paying deep attention to the nonpropositional. This is why the two great critics of Hegel, Nietzsche and Kierkegaard, they're trying to put their finger on the nonpropositional, the nonconceptual, the will to power or faith in Kierkegaard, and they're trying to bring out all these other kinds of knowing as being inadequate. That's why Kierkegaard meant when he said, Hegel made a system and then he sat down beside it. And so Marxism is very much, it is activist, it's about reorganizing society, but the transformation in individuals is largely ideological, meaning it's largely about these significant propositional changes and adopting a set of beliefs. When it came in contact with the Soviet Union or with what became the Soviet Union, why do you think it had such a powerful hold on such a large number of people? Not Marxism, but implementation of Marxism in the name of communism. Because it offered people, I mean, it offered people something that typically only religions had offered, and it offered people the hope of making a new man, a new kind of human being in a new world. And when you've been living in Russia, in which things seem to be locked in a system that is crushing most people, getting the promise in the air of scientific legitimacy that we can make new human beings and a new world and in which happiness will ensue, that's an intoxicating proposal. You get sort of, like I said, you get all of the intoxication of a religious utopia, but you get all the seeming legitimacy of claiming that it's a scientific understanding of history and economics. It's very popular to criticize communism, Marxism these days, and I often put myself in the place before any of the implementations came to be, I tried to think if I would be able to predict what the implementations of Marxism and communism would result in, in the 20th century. And I'm not sure I'm smart enough to make that prediction. Because at the core of the ideas are respecting, with Marx it's very economics type theory, so it's basically respecting the value of the worker and the regular man in society for making a contribution to that society. And to me that seems like a powerful idea, and it's not clear to me how it goes wrong. In fact, it's still not clear to me why the hell would Stalin happen, or Mao happen. There's something very interesting and complex about human nature in hierarchies, about distributed cognition that results in that, and it's not trivial to understand. No, no. So, I mean, I wonder if you could put a finger on it. Why did it go so wrong? So I think, you know, what Ohana talks about in The Intellectual History of Modernity talks about the Promethean spirit, the idea, the really radical proposal. And think about how it's not so radical to us, and in that sense Marxism has succeeded. The radical proposal that you see even in the French Revolution, and don't forget the terror comes in the French Revolution too, that we can make ourselves into godlike beings. Think of the hubris in that, and think of the overconfidence to think that we so understand human nature and all of its complexities and human history, and how religion functioned, that we can just come in with a plan and make it run. To my mind, that Promethean spirit is part of why it's doomed to fail, and it's doomed to fail in a kind of terrorizing way, because the Promethean spirit really licenses you to do anything, because the ends justify the means. The ends justify the means really free you to do some of, basically, well, commit atrocities at any scale. Ground zero with Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge, right, exactly. And you can only believe in an ends that can justify any means if you believe in a utopia, and you can only believe in the utopia if you really buy into the Promethean spirit. So is that what explains Nazism? So Nazism is part of that, too. The Promethean spirit that we can make ourselves into supermen, ubermensch, right? And Nazism is fueled very much by appropriating and twisting sort of Gnostic themes that are very prevalent, Gnosticism tends to come to the fore when people are experiencing increased meaning crisis. And don't forget, the Weimar Republic is like a meaning crisis gone crazy on all levels. Everybody's suffering domicile, everybody's home and way of life and identity and culture and relationship to religion and science, all of that, right? So Nazism comes along and offers a kind of Gnosticism, again, twisted, perverted. I'm not saying that all Gnostics are Nazis, but there is this Gnostic mythology, mythos, and it comes to the fore. I remember, and this stuck with me in undergrad, I was taking political science, and the professor extended lecture on this, and it still rings true for me, says, if you understand Nazism as just a political movement, you have misunderstood it. It is much more a religious phenomenon in many ways. Is it religious in that the loss of religion? So is it a meaning crisis? Or is it out of a meaning crisis every discovery of religion in a Promethean type of... I think it's the latter. I think there's this vacuum created. In that context, is Hitler the central religious figure? Yes. And also, did Nazi Germany create Hitler, or did Hitler create Nazi Germany? So in this distributed cognition where everyone's having a dialogue, what's the role of a charismatic leader? Is it an emergent phenomena, or do you need one of those to kind of guide the populace? I hope it's not a necessary requirement. I hope that the next Buddha can be the Sangha rather than a specific individual. But I think in that situation, Hitler's charisma allowed him to take on a mythological, in the proper sense, archetypal... He became deeply symbolic, and he instituted all kinds of rituals, all kinds of rituals, and all kinds of mythos. There's all this mythos about the master race, and there's all these rituals. The swastika is, of course, itself a religious symbol. There's all of this going on because he was tapping into the fact that when you put people into deeper and deeper meaning scarcity, they will fall back on more and more mythological ways of thinking in order to try and come up with a generative source to give them new meaning making. I should say meaning participating behavior. What is evil? Is this a word you avoid? No, I don't. Because I think part of what we're wrestling with here is resisting the Enlightenment, I mean the historical period in Europe, the idea that evil and sin can just be reduced to immorality, individual human immorality. I think there's something deeper in the idea of sin than just immoral. I think sin is a much more comprehensive category. I think sin is a failure to love wisely so that you ultimately engage in a kind of idolatry. You take something as ultimate, which is not. And that can tend to constellate these collective agents, I call them hyperagents, within distributed cognition that have a capacity to wreak havoc on the world that is not just due to a sort of a sum total of immoral decisions. This goes to Hannah Arendt's thing, and the banality of Eichmann. She was really wrestling with it, and I think she's close to something, but I think she's slightly off. Eichmann is just making a whole bunch of immoral decisions, but it doesn't seem to capture the gravity of what the Nazis did, the genocide and the warfare. And she's right, because you're not going to get just the summation of a lot of individual rather banal immoral choices adding up to what was going on. You're getting a comprehensive parasitic process within massive distributed cognition that has the power to confront the world and confront aspects of the world that individuals can't. And I think when we're talking about evil, that's what we're trying to point to. This is a point of convergence between me and Jonathan Paget. We've been talking about this. So the word sin is interesting. Yes. Are you comfortable using the word sin? I'm comfortable. Because it's so deeply rooted in religious texts. It is. It is. And in part, and I struggle around this because I was brought up as a fundamentalist Christian, and so that is still there within me. There's trauma associated with that. Probably layers of self deception mechanisms. No doubt. No doubt. That you're slowly escaping. Yes. Trying to. And trying to come into a proper respectful relationship with Christianity via a detour through Buddhism, Taoism, and pagan Neoplatonism. Trying to find a way how to love wisely. Yes, exactly. And so I think the term sin is good because somebody may not be doing something that we would prototypically call immoral, but if they're failing to love wisely, they are disconnecting themselves in some important way from the structures of reality. And I think it was Hume. I may be wrong. Hume says, you know, people don't do things because they think it's wrong. They do a lesser good in place of a greater good. And that's a different thing than being immoral. Immoral, we're saying, you're doing something that's wrong. It's like, well, no, no, you know, I'm loving my wife. That's a great thing, isn't it? Yeah. But if you love your wife at the expense of your kids, like, wow, maybe something's going awry here. Right? Well, I love my country. Great. But should you love your country at the expense of your commitment to the religion you belong to? I mean, people should wrestle with these questions. And I think sin is a failure to wrestle with these questions properly. Yeah. To be content with the choices you've made without considering, is there a greater good that could be done? Yeah. Your lecture series on The Meaning Crisis puts us in dialogue in the same way as with the podcast with a bunch of fascinating thinkers throughout history. Yes. For example, Paul Corbin, the man Carl Jung, Tillich, Barfield, is there, can you describe, this might be challenging, but one powerful idea from each that jumps to mind? Yes. Maybe Heidegger? So for Heidegger, one real powerful idea that has had a huge influence on me, he's had a huge influence on me in many ways. He's a big influence on what's called 4E Cognitive Science. And this whole idea about the nonpropositional, that was deeply afforded by Heidegger and Marla Ponti. But I guess maybe the one idea, if I had to pick one, is his critique of ontotheology, his critique of the attempt to understand being in terms of a supreme being, something like that, and how that gets us fundamentally messed up and we get disconnected from being because we are overfocused on particular beings. We're failing to love wisely. We're loving the individual things and we're not loving the ground from which they spring. Can you explain that a little more? What's the difference between the being and the supreme being and why that gets us into trouble? Okay. So, well, we talked about this before, the supreme being is a particular being, whereas being is no thing. It's not any particular kind of thing. And so if you're thinking of being as a being, you're thinking of it in a thingy way about something that is fundamentally no thingness. And so then you're disconnecting yourself from presumably ultimate reality. This takes me to Tillich. Tillich's great idea is understanding faith as ultimate concern rather than a set of propositions that you're asserting, right? So what are you ultimately concerned about? What do you want to be in right relationship to, ratio religio? And is that ultimate? Is that the ultimate reality that you conceive of? Are those two things in sync? This has had a profound influence on me and I think it's a brilliant idea. So some of the others, how do they integrate? Maybe this is Carl Jung and Freud. Which team are you on? I'm on Jung. Freud is the better writer, but Jung has, I think, a model of the psyche that is closer to where cognitive science is heading. He's more prescient. Which aspect of his model of the psyche? Directly. So Freud has a hydraulic model. The psyche is like a steam engine. Things are under pressure and there's a fluid that's moving around. It's like, like this is a record note of this. Jung has an organic model. The psyche is like a living being. It's doing all this opponent processing. It's doing all of this self transcending and growing. And I think that's a much better model of the psyche than the sort of steam engine model. What do you think about their view of the subconscious mind? What do you think their view and your own view of what's going on there in the shadow? So all bad stuff, some good stuff, any stuff at all? Well, I mean, both Freud and Jung are only talking about the psychodynamic unconscious, which is only a small part of the unconscious. Can you elaborate on the psychodynamic? They're talking about the aspects of the unconscious that have to do with your sort of ego development and how you are understanding and interpreting yourself. Yeah. What else is there? There's the unconscious that allows you to turn the noise coming out of my face hole into ideas. There's the unconscious that says, yeah, all that stuff, which is huge and powerful. And they didn't think about that. They're focused on the big romantic stuff that you have to deal with through psychotherapy, that kind of stuff. Which is relevant and important. I'm not dismissing. I'm not saying it doesn't exist, but it's certainly not all of the unconscious. A lot of work that's going on, my colleague and deep friend, Anderson Todd is about, can we take the Jungian stuff and the cognitive science stuff and can we integrate it together theoretically? And so he's working on that, exactly that project. But nevertheless, your sense is there is a subconscious. you ignore things that you should probably not ignore. And that, hopefully we can circle back to it Lux, is related to the meaning issue. Because the very processes that make us adaptively intelligent make us perennially susceptible to self deceptive, self destructive behavior because of the way we misframe the environment in fundamental ways. So to you, meaning is also connected to ideas of wisdom and truth and how we interpret and understand and interact intellectually with the environment. Yes. So what is wisdom? Why do we long for it? How do we and where do we find it? What is it? This is what you use to solve your problems, as I was just describing. Rationality is how you use your intelligence to overcome the problems of self deception that emerge when you're trying to solve your problems. So it's that meta problem. And then the issue is, do you have just one kind of knowing? I think you have multiple ways of knowing, and therefore you have multiple rationalities. And so wisdom is to coordinate those rationalities so that they are optimally constraining and affording each other. So in that way, wisdom is rationally self transcending rationality. Right. So life is a kind of process where you jump from rationality to rationality and pick up a village of rationalities along the way that then turns into wisdom. Yes, if properly coordinated. You mentioned framing. Yes. So what is framing? Is it a set of assumptions you bring to the table in how you see the world, how you reason about the world, how you understand the world? So it depends what you mean by assumptions. If by assumption you mean a proposition, representational or rule, I think that's much more downstream from relevance realization. I think relevance realization refers to, again, constraints on how you are paying attention. And so for me, talking about framing is talking about this process you're doing right now of salient landscaping. What's salient to you? And how is what's salient constantly shifting in a sort of a dynamic tapestry? And how are you shaping yourself to the way that salient landscaping is aspectualizing the world, shaping it into aspects for interaction? For me, that is a much more primordial process than any sort of beliefs we have. And here's why. If we mean by beliefs a representational proposition, then we're in this very problematic position. Because then we're trying to say that propositions are ultimately responsible for how we do relevance realization. And that's problematic because representations presuppose relevance realization. So I represent this as a cup. The number of properties it actually has, and that I even have epistemic access to, is combinatorial explosive. I select from those a subset and how they are relevant to each other insofar as they are relevant for me. This doesn't have to be a cup. I could be using it as a hat, I could use it to stand for the letter V, all kinds of different things. I could say this was the 10th billion object made in North America. Representations presuppose relevance realization. They are therefore dependent on it, which means relevance realization isn't bound to our representational structures. It can be influenced by them, but they are ultimately dependent on relevance realization. Let's define stuff. Relevance realization. Yes. What are the inputs and the outputs of this thing? What is it? What are we talking about? What we're talking about is how you are doing something very analogous to evolution. So if you think about that adaptivity isn't in the organism or in the environment, but in a dynamical relation and then what does evolution do? It creates variation and then it puts selective pressure and what that does is that changes the niche constructions that are available to a species. It changes the morphology. You also have a loop. It's your sensory motor loop and what's constantly happening is there are processes within you that are opening up variation and also processes that are putting selection on it and you're constantly evolving that sensory motor loop. So you might call your cognitive fittedness, which is how you're framing the world is constantly evolving and changing. I can give you two clear examples of that. One, your autonomic nervous system, parasympathetic and sympathetic. The sympathetic system is biased to trying to interpret as much of reality as threat or opportunity. The parasympathetic is biased to trying to interpret as much of the environment as safe and relaxing and they are constantly doing opponent processing. There's no little man in you calculating your level of arousal. There's this dynamic coupling opponent processing between them that is constantly evolving your arousal. Similarly, your attention, you have the default mode network, task network. The default mode network is putting pressure on you right now to mind wander, to go off, to drift, right, and then the task focus network is selecting out of those possibilities the ones that will survive and go into and so you are constantly evolving your attention. Okay, so there's a natural selection of ideas that a bunch of systems within you are generating and then you use the natural selection. What is the selector, the object that you're interacting with, the glass? Relevance realization, once again, you just describe how it happens. Yes. You didn't describe what the hell it is. So what's the goal? What are we talking about? So relevance realization is how you interact with things in the world to make sense of why they matter, what they mean to you, to your life. Yes, and notice the language you just used, you're starting to use the meaning in life language. Good or bad? That's good. Okay. That's good. So what does that evolution of your sensory motor loop do? It gives you, and here I'll use a term from Marlon Ponti, it gives you an optimal grip on the world. So let's use your visual attention again. Okay, here's an object. How close should I be to it? Is there a right? That's what you want to do with it. Exactly. Exactly. So you have to evolve your sensory motor loop in order to get the optimal grip that actually creates the affordance of you getting to a goal that you're trying to get to. Yeah, but you're describing physical goals of manipulating objects, so this applies, the task, the process of relevance realization is not just about getting a glass of water and taking a drink. No. It's about falling in love. Yeah, of course. What else is there? Well, there's obvious. Between those two options. I can show you how you're optimally gripping in an abstract cognitive domain. Okay? So a mammal goes by and most people will say there's a dog. Now why don't they say, they might, but typically, you know, probabilistically they'll say there's a dog. They could say there's a German Shepherd, there's a mammal, there's a living organism, there's a police dog. Why that? Why there? Why did they stop Eleanor Rush called these basic level? Well, what you find is that's an optimal grip because it's getting you the best overall balance between similarity within your category and difference between the other categories. It's allowing you to properly fit to that object in so far as you're setting yourself up to, well, I'm getting so as many of the similarities and differences I can on balance because they're in a trade off relationship that I need in order to probably interact with this mammal. That's optimal grip, not right. It's at the level of your categorization. You evolve these models of the world around you and on top of them, you do stuff like you build representations, like you said, yes. What's the salience landscape? Salience meaning attention landscape. Salience is what grabs your attention or what results from you directing your attention. I clap my hands, that's salient, it grabs your attention. Your attention is drawn to it, that's bottom up, but I can also say you left big toe and now it's salient to you because you directed your attention towards it. That's top down and again, opponent processing going on there. Whatever stands out to you, what grabs your attention, what arouses you, what triggers at least momentarily some affect towards it, that's how things are salient. What salience I would argue is, is how a lot of unconscious relevance realization makes Or at least an unconscious. I like the term unconscious. And Jung continually reminded people that the unconscious is unconscious, that we're not conscious of it. And that's its fundamental property. Yeah, and then isn't the task of therapy then to bring, to make the unconscious conscious? Yeah, to a degree, right? But also, I mean, yeah, to bring consciousness where there was unconscious is part of Jung's mythos. But it's also not the thought that that can be completed. Part of why you're extending the reach of the conscious mind is it so it can enter into a more proper dialogical relationship with the self organizing system of the unconscious mind. What did they have to say about the motivations of humans? So for Freud, jokingly, I said, you know, sex, so much of our mind is developed in our young age, sexual interactions with the world or whatever, hence the thing about the edible complex and all, you know, I wanted to have sex with your mother. What do you think about their description about what motivates humans? And what do you think about the will to power from Nietzsche? Which camp are you in there? What motivates humans? Sex or power? I think Plato is right. And I think there's a connection for me. Plato's my first philosopher, Jung's my first psychologist, and Jung is very much the Plato of the psyche. You never forget your first. Yeah. You never do. You never do. And I think we have, I reject the monological mind, I reject the monophasic mind model. I think we are multi centered. I think we have different centers of motivation that operate according to different principles to satisfy different problems, and that part of the task of our humanity is to get those different centers into some internal culture by which they are optimally cooperating rather than in conflict with each other. What advice would you give to young people today? They're in high school trying to figure out what they're going to do with their life. Maybe they're in college. What advice would you give how to have a career they can be proud of or how to have a life they can be proud of? So the first thing is find an ecology of practices and a community that supports them without involving you in believing things that contravene our best understood science so that wisdom and virtue, especially how they show up in relationships, are primary to you. This will sound ridiculous, but if you take care of that, the other things you want are more likely to occur. Because what you want at when you're approaching your death is what were the relationships you cultivated to yourself, to other people, to the world, and what did you do to improve the chance of them being deep and profound relationships? That's an interesting ecology of practice, finding a place where a lot of people are doing different things that are interesting interplay with each other, but at the same time is not a cult where ideas can flourish. How the hell do you know? Because in a place where people are really excited about doing stuff, that's very ripe for cult formation. Especially if they're awash in a culture in which we have ever expanding waves of bullshit. Yes, precisely. So... Try to keep away from the bullshit is the advice. Yes. No, I mean, I take this very seriously and I was with a bunch of people in Vermont at the respond retreat, people, Rafe Kelly was there, a bunch of people who have set up ecologies of practices and created communities. And I have good reason to find all of these people trustworthy. And so we gathered together to try and generate real dialogos, flow in distributed cognition, exercise the collective intelligence, and try and address that problem, both in terms of metachurriculum that we can offer emerging communities, in terms of practices of vetting, how we will self govern the federation we're forming so that we can resist gurufication. Gurufication of people or ideas? Both. Yeah. Both. Some of us just get unlucky. Some of us get unlucky and we all at respond, we all had a tremendous sense of urgency around this, but we were trying to balance it about not being premature, but there was going to, I mean, we're going to produce a metachurriculum that's coming in months, there's going to be a scientific paper about integrating the scientific work on wisdom with this practitioner based ideas about the cultivation of wisdom, there's going to be projects about how we can create a self correcting vetting system so we can say to people, we think this ecology is legit, it's in good fellowship with all these other legit ecologies, we don't know about that one, we're hesitant about that one, it's not in good fellowship, we have concerns, here's why we have our concerns, et cetera. And you may say, well, who are you to do that? It's like nobody, but somebody's got to do it, right? And that's what it comes down to, and so we're going to give it our best effort. It's worth a try. You talked about the meaning crisis in human civilization, but in your own personal life, what has been a dark place you've ever gone in your mind? Has there been difficult times in your life where you've really struggled? Yes. So when I left fundamentalist Christianity, and for a while I was just sort of a hard bitten atheist, the problem with leaving the belief structure was that I didn't deal with all the nonpropositional things that had gotten into me, all the procedures and habits and all the perspectives and all the identities and the trauma associated with that. So I required therapy, it required years of meditation and Tai Chi, and I'm still wrestling with it, but for the first four or five years, I would... I described it like this, I called it the black burning. I felt like there was a blackness that was on fire inside of me, precisely because the religion had left a taste for the transcendent in my mouth, but it had... The food it had given me, food in square quotes, had soured in my stomach and made me nauseous, and the juxtaposition of those seemed like an irresolvable problem for me. That was a very, very dark time for me. Did it feel lonely? When it was very bad, it felt extremely lonely and deeply alienating. The universe seemed absurd, and there was also existential anxiety. I talk about these things for a reason. I don't just talk about them as things I'm pointing to. I'm talking about them as seeing in myself and in people I care, having undergone them and how they can bring you close to self destructive... I started engaging in kinds of self destructive behavior. So the meaning crisis to you is not just the thing you look outside and see many people struggling. You yourself have struggled. But that's, in fact, the narrative, is I struggled with it, thinking it was a purely personal, idiosyncratic thing. I started learning the kog sai, I started doing the tai chi and the meditation, I started doing all this Socratic philosophy. And when I started to talk about these pieces, I saw my students eyes light up, and I realized, wait, maybe this isn't just something I'm going through. And talking to them and then doing the research and expanding it out, it's like, oh, many people in a shared fashion and also in an individual lonely fashion are going through meaning crisis. Well, we talked a lot about wisdom and meaning, and you said that the goal is to love wisely. So let me ask about love. What's the role of love in the human condition? It's central. I mean, it's even central to reason and rationality. This is Plato, but Spinoza, the most logical of the rationalists. The ethics is written like Euclid's geometry, but he calls it the ethics for a reason, because he wants to talk about the blessed life. And what does he say? He says that ultimately reason needs love, because love is what brings reason out of being entrapped in the gravity well of egocentrism. And Murdoch, Iris Murdoch said, I think really beautifully, love is when you painfully realize that something other than yourself is real. Escaping the gravity well of egocentrism. Beautifully put. A beautiful way to end it. And you're a beautiful human being. Thank you for struggling in your own mind with the search for meaning and encouraging others to do the same. And ultimately to learn how to love wisely. Thank you so much for talking today. It's been a great pleasure, Lex. I really enjoyed it a lot. Thank you so much. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Jon Verweke. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from Hermann Hesse in Siddhartha. I've always believed, and I still believe, that whatever good or bad fortune may come our way, we can always give it meaning and transform it into something of value. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time. information relevant to working memory. That's when it now becomes online for direct sensory motor interaction with the world. So you think the salience landscape, the ocean of salience extends into the subconscious mind? I think relevance does, but I think when relevance is recursively processed, relevance realization such that it passes through sort of this higher filter of working memory and has these properties of being globally accessible and globally broadcast, then it becomes the thing we call salience. And that's, that's, that's really good evidence. There's really good evidence from my colleague at UFT, University of Toronto, Lynn Hasher, that that's what working memory is. It's a higher order relevance filter. That's why things like chunking will get way more information through working memory because it's basically making, it's basically monitoring how much relevance realization has gone into this information. Usually you have to do an additional kind of recursive processing. And that tells you, by the way, when do you need consciousness? When do you need that working memory and that salience landscaping? It's when you're facing situations that are highly novel, highly complex and very ill defined that require you to engage working memory. Okay, got it. So relevance realization is in part the thing that constructs that basic level thing of a dog. When you see it, when you see a dog, you call it a dog, not a German Shepherd, not a mammal, not a biological meat bag. It's a dog. Wisdom. Yes. So what is wisdom? If we return, I think as part of that, we got to relevance realization and then wisdom is accumulation of rationalities. You described the rationality as a kind of starting from intelligence, much of puzzle solving and then rationalities like the meta problem of puzzle solving and then what wisdom is the meta, meta problem of puzzle solving? Yes, in the sense that the meta problem you have when you're solving your puzzles is that you can often fall into self deception. You can misprint. Self deception, right. Right. So knowledge overcomes ignorance, wisdom is about overcoming foolishness if what we mean by foolishness is self deceptive, self destructive behavior, which I think is a good definition of foolishness. And so what you're doing is you're doing this recursive relevance realization. You're using your intelligence to improve the use of your intelligence and then you're using your rationality to improve the use of your rationality. That's that recursive relevance realization I was talking about a few minutes ago. Think about a wise person. They come into highly often messy, ill defined, complex situations usually where there's some significant novelty and what can they do? They can zero in on what really matters, what's relevant and then they can shape themselves, salience landscaping to intervene most appropriately to that situation as they have framed it. That's what we mean by a wise person and that's how it follows out of the model I've been presenting to you. So when we say self deception, I mean part of that implies that it's intentional. Part of the mechanism of cognition, you're modifying what you should know for some purpose. Is that how you see the word self deception? No, because I belong to a group of people that think the model of self deception as lying to oneself ultimately makes no sense. Because in order to lie to you, I have to know something you don't and I have to depend on your commitment to the truth in order to modify your behavior. I don't think that's what we do to ourselves. I think, and I'm going to use it in the technical term and thank you for making space for that earlier on, I think we can bullshit ourselves, which is a very different thing than lying. So what is bullshit and how do we bullshit ourselves, technically speaking? Yeah. Frankfurt and this is inspired by Frankfurt and other people's work based on Frankfurt's work. On bullshit. Yeah. Classic essay. It's a pretty good title. I think it's one of the best things he wrote. He wrote a lot of good things. The title or the essay? The essay. The title's good too. It's always an icebreaker in certain academic settings. So let's contrast the bullshit artist from the liar. The liar depends on your commitment to the truth. The bullshit artist is actually trying to make you indifferent to the question of truth and modify your behavior by making things salient to you so that they are catchy to you. So a prototypical example of bullshit is a commercial, a television commercial. You watch these people at a bar getting some particular kind of alcohol and they're gorgeous and they're laughing and they're smiling and they're clear eyed. You know that's not true and they know you know it's not true, but here's the point. You don't care because there's gorgeous people smiling and they're happy and that's salient to you and that catches your attention. And so you know, go into a bar, you know that won't happen when you drink this alcohol, you know it. Yeah. But you buy the product because it was made salient to you. Now you can't lie to yourself, Lex. Salience can catch attention, but attention can drive salience. So this is what I can do. I can make something salient by paying attention to it and then that will tend to draw me back to it again, which, and you see what happens, which means it tends to catch my attention more so that when I go into the store, that bottle of liquor catches my attention and I buy it. And that's, why is that bullshit? Because what you're doing is being caught up in the salience of things independent from whether or not that salience is tracking reality. Is it independent or is it loosely connected? Because it's not so obvious to me when I see happy people at a bar that I don't in part believe that, well, my experience has been maybe different. Logically, I can understand, but maybe there is a bar out there where it's all happy people dancing. In fact, most of the bars I go to these days in Texas, there's pretty lots of happy people. I think you can, I mean, there's probably variation, although I think it's very the truth seeking in there. Let's say the intent is at least to try and shut off your truth seeking. It might not completely succeed, but that's the intent. At times it can completely succeed because I can give you pretty much gibberish and never let it will motivate your behavior. There's an episode from the classic Simpsons, not the modern Simpsons, the classic Simpsons where there's aliens and they're running for office in the United States. Now I'm a Canadian, so this doesn't quite work for me, but right. And this speech goes like this, my fellow Americans, when I was young, I dreamt of being a baseball, but we must move forward, not backward. Upward, not forward, twirling, twirling towards freedom and people go, and there's a rush. There's nothing there. And yet it's great satire because a lot of political speech is exactly like that. There's nothing there. Right? Well, I'm not saying all political speech, I said a lot. There's a fundamental difference between, and it's so hilarious, I remember that episode. There's a fundamental difference between that absurd sort of non secular speech and political speech because one of the things is political speech is grounded in some sense of truth. And so if that requires you talking about alternative facts and weird self destructive oxymoronic phrases, isn't that approaching pure bullshit? No, I think pure bullshit, like the vacuum is very difficult to get to, but I get the point. So what exactly is truth? Is it possible to know? I think Spinoza's right about truth, that truth is only known by its own standard, which sounds circular. There's a way in which he didn't mean that circularly, and I think this is also converges with Plato. These are two huge influences on me. I think we only know the truth retrospectively when we go through some process of self transcendence, when we move from a frame to a more encompassing frame so that we can see the limitations and the distortions of the earlier frame. You have this when you have a moment of insight. Insight is you doing, you are re realizing what is relevant. You go, oh, oh, I thought she was aggressive and angry. She's actually really afraid. I was misframing this and you change what you find relevant. You have those aha moments. So do you think it's possible to get a sense of objective reality? So is it possible to get to the ground level of something that you can call objective truth? Or are we always on shaky ground? I think those moments of transcendence can never get us to an absolute view from nowhere. And so this is Drew Hyland's notion of finite transcendence. We are capable of self transcendence, and therefore we are creatures who can actually raise the question of truth, or goodness, or beauty, because I think they all share this feature. But that doesn't mean we can transcend to a godhood, to some absolute view from nowhere that takes in all information and organizes it in a comprehensive whole. But that doesn't mean that truth is thereby rendered valueless. I think a better term is real. And real and illusory are comparative terms. You only know that something's an illusion by taking something else to be real. And so we're always in a comparative task, but that doesn't mean that we can somehow jump outside of our framing in some final manner and say, this is how it is from a God's eye point of view. So what do you think, if I may ask, of somebody like Ayn Rand and her philosophy of objectivism? So where the core principle is that reality exists independently of consciousness and that human beings have direct contact with reality through sense perception. So they have that, you do have that ability to know reality. There's two things. Knowing that there's an independent reality is not knowing that independent reality. Those are not the same thing. Yeah, but I think objectivism would probably say that our human reason is able to have contact with that. Then I would respond and say, I believe, in fact, ultimately, in a conformity theory of knowing that the deepest kind of knowing is when there's a contact, a conformity between the mind, the embodied mind and reality, and here's where I guess I'd push back on Rand. I would say you have to acknowledge partial knowledge as real knowledge, because if you don't, you're going to fall prey to Meno's paradox. Meno's paradox is, you know, it's in Plato, right? To know P. Well, if I don't know P, I'm going to go looking for it. But if I don't know P, how could I possibly recognize it when I found it? I have no way of recognizing it. I have no way of knowing that I found it. So I must know P. But if I know P, then I don't need to learn about it. I don't need to go searching. So learning doesn't exist. Knowledge is impossible. The way you break out of that paradox is saying, no, no, no, it is possible to partially know something. I can know it enough that it will guide me to recognizing it, but that's not the same as having a complete grasp of it, because I still have to search and find what I don't yet possess in my knowledge. So partial knowledge has to be real knowledge. Right. Partial knowledge is still knowledge. Yes. What do you think about somebody like Donald Hoffman, who thinks the reality is an illusion, so complete illusion, that we're given this actually really nice definition or idea that you talked about, that there's a tension between the illusory and what is real. He says that basically we've taken that and we've ran with the real to the point where the real is not at all connected to some kind of physical reality. I hope to talk to him at some point. You were supposed to talk at one point, and so I have to talk in his absence. I think that, first of all, I think saying that everything is an illusion is like saying everything is tall. It doesn't make any sense. It's a comparative term. You have to say, against this standard of realness, this is an illusion. And he uses arguments from evolution, which are problematic to me because it's like, well, you seem to be saying that evolution is true, that it really exists, and then some of our cognition and our perception has access to reality, math and presumably some science has access to reality. And then what he seems to be saying is, well, a lot of your everyday experience is illusory, but we do have some contact with reality, whereby we can make the arguments as to why most of your experience, most of your everyday experience is an illusion. But to me, that's not a novel thing. That's Descartes. That's the idea that most of our sense experience is untrustworthy, but the math is what connects us to reality. That's how he interpreted the Copernican revolution. Oh, look, we're all seeing the sun rise and move over and set, and it's all an illusion, but the math, the math gets us to the reality. Well, I think he makes a deeper point that most of cognition is just evolved and operates in the illusory world. How does he know that things like cognition and evolution exist? I think there's an important distinction between evolution and cognition, right? No, no, I'm just saying that's not the point I'm making. I'm making a point that he's claiming that there are two things that really exist. Why are they privileged? He basically says that, look, the process of evolution makes sense, right? Like it makes sense that you get complex organisms from simple organisms through the natural selection process. Whereas how you get to transfer information from generation to generation, it makes sense. And then he says that there's no requirement for the cognition to evolve in a way that it would actually perceive and have direct contact with the physical reality. Except that cognition evolved in such a way that it could perceive the truth of evolution. And you can't treat evolution like an isolated thing. Evolution depends on Darwinian theory, genetics. It depends on understanding plate tectonics, the way the environment changes. It depends on how chromosomes are structured. Actually, that's an interesting question to him, where I don't know if he actually would push back on this, is how do you know evolution is real? Yes. I think he would be open to the idea that it is part of the illusion that we constructed, that there's some, in some sense, it is connected to reality, but we don't have a clear picture of it. I mean, that's an intellectually honest statement then, if most of our cognition as thinking beings is operating at every level in an illusory world, then it makes sense that this, one of the main theories of science, that's evolution, is also a complete part of this illusory world. Right. But then what happens to the premise for his argument leading to the conclusion that cognition is illusory? I think he makes a very specific argument about evolution as an explanation of why the world is, of our cognition operating in an illusory world. But that's just one of the explanations. I think the deeper question is why do we think we have contact with reality, with physical reality? It's, we could be very well living in a virtual world constructed by our minds in a way that makes that world deeply interesting in some ways, whether it's somebody playing a video game or we're trying to, through the process of distributed cognition, construct more and more complex objects. Like why do we have to, why does it have to be connected to like physics and planets and all that kind of stuff? Okay. So if we're going to say like we're now considering it as a possibility rather than it's a conclusion based on arguments, because the arguments, again, will always rely on stipulating that there is something that is known. These are the features of cognition. Cognition is capable of illusion. That's a true statement. You're somehow in contact with the mind. Why does the mind have this privileged contact and other aspects like my body do not? So that's, but let's put that aside and now let's just consider it. Now when we put it that way, it's not an epistemic question anymore. It's an existential question and here's my reply to you. There's two possibilities. Either the illusion is one that I cannot discover, sort of, you know, the matrix on steroids or something. There's no way. Because what I do, I can't find out that it's an illusion or it's an illusion, but I can find out that it's an illusion. Those are the two possibilities. Nothing changes for me if those are the two possibilities, because if I could not find,\n",

      "Text: The following is a conversation with Zach Bitter, ultramarathon runner and coach who held multiple world records in the 100 mile run and other ultra endurance events. He is currently training for a run across America, which for now is planned for September this year. Like many of the things Zach has done in the past, this is a big, fascinating challenge. Quick mention of our sponsors, Ladder, Valcampo, Noom, and BetterHelp. Check them out in the description to support this podcast. As a side note, let me say that Zach has been advising and coaching me on my own running journey. I want to mention that Zach sent me some running shoes from Ultra, which I think is a company that sponsors him. When I put those shoes on, I feel like Zach is watching me, and I get that extra motivation to make him proud. And by that, I mean I want to put a lot of miles on those shoes. Running is something that has always been difficult for me, but I love it because it is difficult. The hardest part is I'm left alone with my thoughts for one or two hours. Some thoughts are dark, like thinking about mortality, my own and that of others. Some are self critical, like personal weaknesses or dreams not realized. Some are simply human feelings of loneliness, personal and existential. And yet, there are the moments during a run when all that fades and I'm left empty of negative thoughts and full of appreciation for the beauty of experience, of nature, life, the whole thing. This is why I return to running. Not to get in shape, but to face myself and to run through it. That's why I'm inspired by people like Zach and by David Goggins and others like them who seek to find the limits of their body and mind. This is the Lex Friedman podcast and here is my conversation with Zach Bitter. Where does your mind go when you're running an ultra marathon? Are there a lot of positive thoughts, negative thoughts, demons, inspirational things, maybe no thoughts at all? Yeah, that's the really interesting part of the sport, I think, because you can essentially what it is when we're looking at like the hundred mile distance or anything that's like all day long is you're going to have the full range of the full spectrum of emotions of mental processes, both kind of positive, negative and in between. So it almost feels like you've lived multiple, multiple lives or full life, maybe it was way to say it in that one time period. So it's like a it's almost like assimilation of what you may experience in a long period of time in a very condensed period of time. And I think that's just a weird mental process to reflect upon. And that's what kind of draws people back to it. But I mean, it's a battle, too, because if you're looking at it from a performance standpoint versus an experience, you obviously want to minimize the negative mindset stuff. You want to try to keep those emotions and those thought processes at a low. And I think when you can keep yourself from letting those thoughts creep in, they you end up having better races and it's it can spiral in either direction. Like I notice like there's there's kind of like this scenario that occurs where in the beginning, like a negative thing creeps in your mind. It's like super easy just to slap it down and say, like, get out of here. You know, I did the training, I'm fit, I'm feeling fresh still. You know, everything's going well at this point in time. You get a little further along in the race and you're starting to feel a bit of the fatigue, I mean, a little bit of self doubt creeps in. You start asking yourself, well, you know, maybe I should have done one more long run or did I did I not quite taper long enough? And those things can kind of spiral into a negative way. And if if you let it keep going, it keeps going all the way to like, why am I here? Why am I doing this? This is stupid. All the way to like, there's another one of these two weeks from now, I'm going to drop out of this one and sign up for that one instead. And then you just find yourself in the exact same situation. So you kind of have to go through the process, I think is why I think there's kind of a I won't say it's a rule of thumb necessarily, but something I think is fairly valuable is if you do a hundred mile or the first time, make sure you get it done, even if it means like, you know, death marching is what they'll call it in the alternate community at the end of the race. Just to say, like, you got that full experience, you experience the highs, the lows, the full thing, the starting, the crossing the finish line, that release of emotion when you're done and all that stuff. So that when you go back to do it again, you have like a template to build off of, then you know, or you just have some data to pull from about how your mind is going to work as well as your body so that you can start practicing Well, what do I have to do to kind of keep my mind from spiraling in a negative direction? Or how do I catch some positive momentum and kind of keep sending it that way, and things like that. And that just I think, you just add to that over a career of running them or a series of running them and it sharpens. It's kind of like any sport with that where, you know, you always have this balance between the youthfulness that you may have earlier in your career versus the wise intelligence that you have maybe near the end of your career. So in terms of wisdom, is there mechanisms by which you kind of observe the negative thoughts and let them go? So you have a people like the David Goggins is who kind of this, he seems to almost like separate his mind into there's the weak David that he hates. And then there's this strong, strong one. I mean, there's like a very contentious relationship there. So he basically says, like, I refuse to be that person. And he's almost like angry at that person. It's almost like sometimes literally yelling at that person, the weak version of themselves. And then there's another more sort of Sam Harris the approach, which is like, just observe the thought and let it go. Maybe knowing that this too shall pass, like no matter what it, this moment will not last forever. And kind of sort of accepting the natural flow of things and taking one step at a time and allowing whatever the negativity, whatever the pain you're experiencing just to pass, even if it means a death march, which one is more effective for you? Which one, like, would you say generally speaking to the population is more effective? Yeah, that's a really good question. It's probably unique to the individual. I wouldn't argue that, you know, David is finding success with his approach. Some may argue it's an extreme version. You know, Sam has obviously thought about these things and really probably, you know, I see those guys as kind of two ends of the spectrum in just the way that they kind of come across in general, where like David's like really at your kind of high energy and Sam's kind of this calming, soft presence and he's just going to slowly, methodically lay it all out there. And I think there's value on in both of those. I think most people are probably going to get a benefit from pulling some from each. I mean, there's times where, where I need a kick in the ass and then it's like, have the strong Zach, tell the weak Zach to get moving. But there's also times where, you know, it's just like, you know, a subtle voice entering my head about, you know, I don't know if I feel quite right now. Should I maybe pull back on the pace? And I think that little subtle voice is best approached with a subtle positive voice where it's more like, okay, well let's think this through here for a second. You're 40 miles into a hundred mile race. You spent four months preparing for it. Uh, you know, from the workouts you did that you're ready for this, there really isn't any real reason for you to slow down or to fall off your goal or your pace or, you know, reassess what you're doing. Let's just give this another mile or two. And then we can reassess if we need to, and in order to kind of figure out if I'm doing the right things or not. And I think like in that situation, um, you definitely probably want to lean more towards the Sam Harris approach with that because there's really no reason to, it's almost like the same thing you see with like just training and even nutrition to a degree where like some folks, they just want to be like, kind of like drilled. They want to be like yelled at and said, like, get going, get doing this. And that helps and that motivates them. That helps them stay accountable. Other people need some softer love with it where it's like, you know, this isn't necessarily your thought, your, your fault. You were put in this environment that kind of created an atmosphere of lethargy and lethargy and maybe poor nutritional choices and things like that. And, and like, so, but it's, it's correctable. So we need to, we need to step away from that and we need to kind of start heading in the direction that we know is going to bear fruit down the road. And that person may respond better to that. So I think both those guys have great value with their approaches. They're just probably polar ends of that, of the spectrum. And I think most people are probably going to benefit like anything, right? You get the polarizing ones and those are going to work right for the polarizing people. But then most people are going to fit somewhere in the middle. So they're probably going to be able to kind of pull from both of those if they're able to sit down and kind of like assess which one's going to work better in which situation. So the quitting thing that you mentioned, the, like the final stage, which actually I get to much quicker than you seem to, which is like, why am I doing this? I get there with basically anything I do. It's like, this is, this is probably the stupidest thing I've ever done is the feeling I get often. And then immediately you have these excuses that are like, there's all these other better things you should be doing. Or, or the other alternative of that, like you said, I'm not prepared enough for this moment. I'll be much more prepared in two weeks for the next event. So like, why let's try this again. Let's start over. Let's start over in two weeks. How do you deal with that quit? Like, so maybe do you still go through that process and and by way of advice for people that are more sort of amateurish like me, how to deal with that quitting voice? I think a lot of times when the quitting voice kind of comes in, it, what it does is it kind of just, it comes in with the added disadvantage, I guess, in this situation of being kind of a narrow scoped view where you're looking at like, what it's doing to you in the moment or how you're feeling in the moment versus how are you feeling about the whole process? So one thing that I started doing in 2019, and I think, I don't think it's necessarily, I think, I think, I think this was a big reason why I had one of my best racing seasons in 2019 that I'd had to that date. It was part of it was I started, I think, putting a little more emphasis on the big picture versus putting emphasis on like, this is one opportunity or one day of work. And this is one, one emotional kind of flare up. But how does that actually relate to my general broader picture? So when I decide to do a race or an event or something like that, it's often four, six months out ahead of time, you're planning to like kind of do a series of workouts and a flow of things where you're going through the process of getting fit, getting ready, preparing for the specifics of the day and all that stuff. And then you get to the race itself or the event itself. And it's very easy to look at that and think that's an isolation. Like I'm going to run 12 hours today, or I'm going to run a hundred miles today or whatever it ends up being. And it's a lot easier to quit when you think to yourself, I'm 40 miles into a hundred mile race. You know, that's just a 40 mile run, which sounds kind of silly to most people, but in perspective, then we're talking about the ultra marathon running community. You know, it's a lot easier just to say like, well, you know, I'll scrap this 40 miles and try again. It's a lot harder to say I'm going to scrap the entire last four months, the entire reason why I was doing it, the countless hours I spent in there. So I think I just try to reposition it of like, I'm in a bad place right now, maybe in my head or I'm not, I'm hitting a low point here, but I'm 99% of the way towards the goal I set out four months ago when I add in all the work I did leading up to that. So I think it's important to ask yourself why, because, I mean, there are times when you're doing something and you ask yourself why, and you don't have a good reason. And then maybe it is advantageous to step back and really reflect on that and decide, is this something I actually want to invest time and energy into? Because, you know, someone like yourself who is very much into a variety of different things, it can be easy probably to overextend and get, I mean, I'm a very curious person. So there's like a hundred things I would love to do if I wasn't doing what I'm doing. And I know how to enjoy all of them. So at a certain point though, you have to say, okay, which one is going to be the most meaningful for me? And if the answer keeps coming back to saying, I guess this is still the most meaningful to me out of that a hundred things that I could otherwise be doing, then I know that I'm in it for the right reason. Then I just need to identify some of those things like, well, why did this one take the top spot out of the hundred things that I could have picked from? And keeping like a list of those in your head so that when you get to that point where you start saying, why am I doing this? Why am I here? You just have those kind of ready loaded in your head to say, well, I already took inventory on that before I started this. And I knew this voice was going to come at some point, whether it's early, middle or late. And then you just remind yourself kind of what you were thinking when you had a little more of a level head. Well, there's something about the thing you mentioned when you mentioned the death march. It seems extremely valuable to just never quitting. Like in the moment, if you decide to do something, like never quitting, even if you do go through the process and realize that it's not the wisest thing to be doing within the full context of your life. Like once you decide to do it, it seems like never quitting prevents you from sort of having that escape clause from other things in your life. So I've quit on a few things in my life. And I think I still, I deeply regret that because it opened that door. It's almost like a muscle. I don't know. So I think I'm, I don't know, maybe everyone is, but I think I'm kind of a quitter. You know what I mean? Like I'm really good at coming up with reasons to quit. My mind is really good at that. And I, it feels like I have to come up with, like really work hard to make sure that there's no quit. That I never allow myself to quit no matter how stupid the thing I'm doing is. I don't know if that any of that makes sense, but it just, maybe to rephrase this whole thing. Do you think it's good to live life by the ethos of never quit? Yeah, that's a really interesting thing. And I think it actually resonates with a lot of ultra marathon runners because there seems to be a trend when you have someone who's been in the sport for a long time where there's a point where they start the sport, right? And they're like, super excited about everything. Everything's new. It's very easy not to quit because you're like, Oh, this is the first time I've ever run a 50 case. The first time I ever run a 50 miles, the first time I ever in a hundred case, first time I ever in a hundred miles and so on and so forth. And when you're doing that for the first time, I think there's a heightened motivation to not quit because you don't want your first attempt to be a failure. And then you get a little further along and you start reflecting on the landscape and all the opportunities that are out there and you find yourself quitting on an event. And there does seem to be a trend where once you do that once, now all of a sudden, like you, like you described perfectly that quit pops up in your head maybe a little sooner than next time or maybe a little bit before. And I've certainly had these experiences in my career as well. And what happens, I think if you stick with it, again, I think it is important to assess whether you really want to be doing what you're doing. But if you start recognizing that about yourself in a certain activity where it's like, I think I might be pulling the plug early on some of this stuff. I think you just need to kind of get into a position where you just at that point, you need to make a decision. Do I want to keep doing this? If the answer is yes, you hold yourself accountable to not quitting. And eventually what will happen is you'll find yourself in a position where I'll use ultra marathons, for example, where you're just clicking on all cylinders for that day. And you still get those scenarios where doubt creeps in your mind. You have these low points, but for whatever reason, when those low points are high, you're going to find yourself in a reason when those low points come, you're able to push through them better than you would have in the past. And then you push through maybe two or three more than you did after you had quit the time before. Then it's accountability time, right? Because then you have to look back at that and say, well, why did this time, was I able to be mentally more strong and kind of push through those extra opportunities to quit when I wasn't before? And it can be easy to look back and say, and live kind of retroactively in the sense where you're regretting, well, why did I drop out of those races? Why did I do this wrong there? And I just think that's where you have to kind of catch yourself and say, no, those things happened to me in order to put me in a position where I decided, well, this time I'm not going to quit no matter what, minus my leg falling off. I'm not going to quit. And then you put yourself in a position to have that day where you push through more times than you ever have before. And you just redefine what you're capable of. And then once I think you do that, you start looking at those earlier lessons as, as lessons, you know, were they failures on paper at the time? Probably. But can you pull things from them to learn as to like, well, where is your actual threshold? Where is the limit actually for you? And then kind of start redefining that stuff. Um, so I think like the never quit mentality can be good in certain situations, but I don't think it's necessarily like a, like a holistic thing where you need to be in something where it's never quit, always do more. Cause then you end up in a situation where you find this like margin of diminishing returns, especially when it comes to training and workouts and things like that, where there are times where often there are times where you want to actually quit a little bit before you would have to, because the stress that was required to elicit a, a growth response has already occurred. And then just to do more is just going to require more recovery time to get back and do it again. Yeah. This is the tricky trade off living by the never quit mentality. You're not going to achieve optimal performance in your head. You might. It seems like when you look at the full arc of human history, the people who do great things are more leaning towards the never quit. Like, uh, I feel like at any one moment you're more in danger of quitting than you are being suboptimal. So like, um, in terms of advice, it just feels like never quitting is always the right advice. Unless you deeply know the person, maybe this is like wrestling mentality. I've seen too many, and because I'm annoyed with the current culture telling me to relax and, and, uh, have a work life balance and all those kinds of things, uh, which all have a deep, deep truth to them. But the reality is like, there's not enough people that walk up to me and like slap me and say, get your shit together. Like don't quit, work harder. I think we need to hear that more. I, and like, I remember that, um, from the wrestling rooms, like that when you're pushed that way, when you're forced to the very limit and you don't quit, that makes better humans. I think people need to get that in their life. I think they need to have situations where that becomes kind of the reality for them so they can see that avenue, experience intensity. And, uh, if you're seeing that continually go down, you're heading in the right direction. If you start seeing it go the opposite way, you're, you're probably overreaching where you're trying to do too much of it. So that's kind of dictates how much the dose, I guess you'd say, when we talk about max aerobic function, we're talking about heart rate as the ultimate, as the really important metric here. So maintaining a particular heart rate during the run. Uh, is that the measure that, like, how do you know you're in the right place? Yeah. Yeah. And then that's where it gets a little tricky because like, unless you go into a lab and get your aerobic threshold tested, it's really hard to have like an exact number on it. Um, you know, Dr. Phil Maffetone with the maximum function process, he'll say 180 minus your age is going to give you your. Yeah. That's the MAF 180 formula that I thought was fascinating for, it's like, uh, in the same way E equals E equals MC squared is fascinating that there could be a formula that captures like optimal running. So that for people who don't know that's 180 minus your age, if you train at that heart rate, if you run at that heart rate, you're going to progress a lot. And here's the advantage of that. I think like with any of these things, you want to look at it through where are the advantages here and I need to account for those. And then where are the potential disadvantages and then decide for me as an individual, do these advantages outweigh the disadvantages on what's the alternative approach and is that going to produce more advantages or less? So with, with maximum function, uh, here's some advantages. Like it is low enough intensity where you can train pretty consistently at a fairly high volume with a very low injury risk with a very low, like things that are going to maybe lower your quality of life, like muscle damage and things like that. Um, it's a more efficient way in the sense that you're going to be like prioritizing like fat metabolization, which, um, I mean, if you're looking at like Jeff Follick and Dr. Jeff Follick and Dr. Dominic DiAgostino, some of their research and things like that, like they're going to show that, you know, that's going to be a little cleaner way to go about things from just a recovery standpoint, a breakdown standpoint. So they could be like a, what they call like a fat adapted athlete. So you can go to your fat stores for energy if you're applying this math. What is it called by the way? Math 180. Is that a good, what are your thoughts about in general for yourself and for the broader population? I think the math 180 formula is about as good of a formula as you're going to find in terms of capturing as many people as you can get away with capturing with a kind of a universal thing. Uh, like any of these things, I mean, it's, it's more likely kind of on a bell curve where like the bulk of that 180 minus their age is probably going to be a pretty good, at least starting point to kind of figure out where that is. There's some other things you can like maybe use to kind of check it that I like to do. If I'm, let's say I just, I did 180 minus my age and I went out and I started running and it was like, I'm running along and I'm just like, my, my breathing is labored. I'm, you know, I'm struggling to get a sentence out without gasping for breath. Well, that's my body telling me I'm probably not actually at my true like math number or my true, like underneath my true aerobic threshold, like aerobic threshold and maximum function, you should be able to do that for hours and you should be able to breathe pretty efficiently and talk. Yep. Carry a conversation. Um, other people will say, like you, another way to kind of gauge it, if you can breathe in your nose and out your mouth, that's not necessarily the best way to do on a, from a performance standpoint, but it can be a good kind of governor that will allow you to, like, if you can, if you can no longer breathe in your nose and out your mouth, you're probably going too fast to actually technically be at your math pace or under your math pace. Yeah. I had, uh, actually when I was in, in better shape, I had trouble getting to that math number. I found myself like that I would be doing way too much work. Like it was too hard to do. It was too hard to get to that number. I was running a much lower heart rate, like 10 to 20, what do you call that beats lower. And that's, I was still for myself, happy with the pace. It was a good pace and, and I was, felt good. I was smiling and enjoying life and, uh, I did. And the moment I take myself to that, uh, level of like the, the math 180 level, that's like, that felt like a real workout. Yeah. And it felt like I can't do that for five, 10, 15 miles. Like I, I started feeling it like this is a one or two mile thing. No, but I think his answer to that, uh, Phil Meftone's answer is maybe you're supposed to like, uh, what, maybe do some more sprints or something like that, or build up your, maybe like I'm too weak. Yeah. Musculature wise to like, uh, yeah, like that, that's a sign that you need to work on some stuff. You can't just keep enjoying life. There's, there's two ways to look at that, I think. And I think you're, you're, you're right on. I think that what the advice from that, from that kind of a process would say is either you, you're doing too much of it. So it's getting too hard for where your skeletal muscle system is currently at for that particular activity. So like, it can be different too. Like if you're cycling versus running, you know, that's a little bit of different mechanic where it can be different where you could take a super fit cyclist and then put them on, you know, the, the volume, the volume they're going to be able to tolerate relative to what you're going to do when you remove like impact forces and things like that is going to be lower if they haven't been practicing that activity. So for you, like, you know, you're prioritizing, like, uh, uh, wrestling and mixed martial arts or not mixed martial arts, but jujitsu type stuff. So, uh, you know, running is maybe kind of that, that, uh, that secondary activity versus the primary activity. But yeah, so what they would say is probably like, maybe instead of doing that at, let's say you were doing that for like 30 miles a week or something like that, and it was getting too hard to continue there, they'd say, you know, come back to 20, get used to 20, get comfortable with 20, then let's get you up to 25 and 30 and kind of just like inch you along. One of the intuitions I had about the ways I was failing at running is the form was probably not great. Like the way to get to those 30, 40 miles is to get the form right. Maybe I was doing too big of steps, not so like playing with a different gate, playing with a different kind of, um, the form of your form, the economy, the efficiency. Yeah. So that was, that was the intuition. Like I was doing something wrong, but I suppose that's the benefit of these kind of formulas. It challenges you to think like, how can I improve this kind of stuff? Well, and it also, it simplifies it so much that you're forced to, right? You're forced to optimize within that real strict parameter versus am I doing my short intervals right, but my long runs wrong? Or am I doing my like long intervals right, but my short intervals, and then you just, it kind of complicates things when you start throwing a lot of stuff there. And for most people, especially when they're first getting started, you know, you're, you can't overcomplicate it or you're just going to like, you're going to do like a bunch of half right, half wrong things and then not really know where your progress or your deficits are necessarily at. So I do think this is an amazing approach, especially for people who are just getting into it and building that, that foundation, um, where, where I think maybe you want to deviate from that a little bit, especially when you start getting to these events that are operating well outside that intensity. So you take something like, um, you know, let's say it's a race that takes you in the neighborhood of around like 12 minutes or something like that, then you're going to be running significantly faster than your, your maximum function pace. So most of the research is going to say at some point in time, you need to get around to practicing the pace at which you're going to perform at and really fine tuning the mechanics, uh, the efficiencies, uh, how it feels, how to judge it, how to pace it at the pace you're going to try to compete at. So there's obviously like a large range of targets there when we're talking about the endurance world in general, where, you know, you have these shorter events, like five kilometers, and then you also have a hundred mile races, which are going to typically be quite a bit below your maximum heroic function in, especially on these trail races. I need to admit something. So I don't measure the runs at all in terms of, uh, time, uh, because I get competitive with myself. So I kind of decided that running for me is going to be this thing where I just go by feel. Is it possible to be that kind of runner and, you know, still have running as part of your life and be a good performer in running? I actually think that's, that's where you want to get to. The problem is most people have a hard time getting to that because they'll go out and they'll run with a friend and match their pace. Or they'll go out and they'll say, well, I want to run this pace. So they'll target that pace or target a specific heart rate, which is, you know, not necessarily how they maybe feel good doing it. So I think like once you, I mean, obviously I think when you put a race on the calendar, if your goal is performance, it's a little harder to just say like, well, I'm going to run whatever feels good today because eventually you have to get around to doing what's specific. But from just a fitness standpoint, health standpoint, enjoyment standpoint, um, I think it's totally fine to go out and say, I'm going to run what feels good today. And you know, maybe someday you will feel like at the end of the run, I'm going to do a couple of sprints just to get some, you know, that, because it does, that one's a hard one to kind of jumpstart, but once you do it and you realize how kind of good it feels, maybe to throw in a few accelerations at the end of a run. And then you, you say, oh wow, that feels pretty good to do that. I feel a little more accomplished. That's right. That's a forcing function, but I like to finish runs with sprints anyway. Okay. Because you're already there without, right. You don't need to the timing. I'm afraid of the time becoming a drug, but the flip side of that, it's a useful tool to get you to learn the right form, the right feel, like what it feels like to have to be in good shape. And then you can throw out the time. Well, I think too with, with feel running. And what I mean by that is that kind of back to that perceived effort thing where like you do enough of it and you start being able to recognize, like I can go out and if you said, okay, run, you know, 60 minutes at your aerobic threshold, I could go, I could know where that is on my heart rate. And I could go out there and just say like, okay, I know what that feels like and go out and run that feel. And I'm going to hit that spot. Like I bet you if we looked at my heart rate data after that, it'd be right in there. And I wouldn't have to look at some of that's just experience. Someone's just understanding like when like noticing the physiological responses, when you cross over versus step a little bit too below it, uh, you can get yourself daydreaming and forget. I'll do this sometimes too, where I'll be tart. Cause I'm kind of like you too, where when I'm getting really fit, uh, especially with my foundation, like I gotta, you know, I'm moving pretty quick at my aerobic threshold. So like if I start daydreaming too much, I can notice, Oh, I'm drifting back a little bit. I looked down at my heart rate matter. Oh yeah, I'm 10 beats under, you know, so you do it. It does take a little bit of, I think just awareness. Um, but it's also not necessarily something where you have to be so exact that you're hitting things, you know, an exact heart rate all the time. There's usually a range and there's even like some fluctuations where like if you've been healthy for a year or two without any injuries and you've been fit that you can probably add five beats to your maximum aerobic function. If you're using that as kind of your, your target from the 180 minus your age formula. So let's try this, lay this out for yourself, but for others, you, you offer readymade plans for people, you know, depending on their, I think the key thing there is the distance. Maybe you can elaborate, but what does that plan look like? Usually what are the key options as you've already kind of mentioned? And how does your week look like? How do a lot of people's week look like in terms of splits? Are we talking about, um, you know, in terms of rest days, in terms of how often do you do speed work versus longer distance? You mentioned long runs. Like, is there something you could say that's generally applicable about the, the structure of these plans? The readymade plans, I definitely follow like a philosophy, um, and it's going to be like kind of like lockstep in that. Um, so for those, like there's always going to be a sacrifice when you do like a readymade plan because there's, you're removing the individual context there. So for folks who are like really want to get into the weeds, I usually do like a personalized coaching plan with them where we sit down and we actually look at their strengths, their weaknesses and really kind of go in from that perspective and fine tune it. And it also like it avoids it avoids a situation where, Oh, my readymade plan says I'm supposed to do this run today, but I don't feel great today. So what do I do? I mean, some people are fine with that because they're, they're, they're aware enough of like the process that they can adjust it themselves. Other folks just need a little more support. So, um, that's kind of the difference there, but in terms of the structure of it, it kind of goes with an approach where ogre saying you build this foundation, you're going to spend, you know, usually anywhere between eight to 12 weeks just building up your, your aerobic foundation. You're going to be doing a lot of stuff that are kind of at, I call them base runs, but they're basically your maximum aerobic function or you're up to your aerobic threshold type stuff. And they're really going to get really fit with that. And once they kind of have that foundation laid, then it's time to get into the specifics of whatever distance they're doing. So if it, where it will differ will be like if they're doing a right now on those plans, I think I've got 5k half marathon marathon, 50k, 80 to a hundred K and then a hundred miles. So if they pick a 5k plan, the order of operations is going to be different than if they pick the a hundred mile plan, you're going to see some of the same workouts show up in that plan. It just going to be different areas of it. So once they're really fit at that, uh, you know, that foundational level, then, you know, if they're doing say a hundred mile plan, they might start doing some short intervals, which I would, on my plans, I usually range between 30 seconds up to four minutes. It's kind of that short interval range. Can you describe what you mean by short interval? It's like a sprint and then a rest. Yeah. Yeah. So I'll use basically like, I'll use like a, basically a 12 minute time trial and that's going to kind of like dictate for them what the intensity and the pace is going to be for some of those. When they're under a minute, they'll push past that a little bit. Um, but usually when we're up to like above a minute and certainly up to four minutes, like whatever pace or intensity that they get for that kind of 12 minute time trial, where they're just seeing how far they can go in 12 minutes is going to be, um, kind of like about where they're going to target for those intervals. So then those intervals are going to be structured. Let's say we were doing two minute intervals. They're going to do two minutes at that intensity that they could do for 12 minutes at a time trial. Then they're going to do a two minute real easy jog, or maybe even walk just to kind of bounce back. And they're going to repeat it. How do you figure out how far you can go in 12 minutes? Is that just a trial and error you build up to it? There's formulas with, yeah, there's some newer formulas that are probably a little less, uh, um, brutal, uh, where you kind of, uh, I haven't really dove into these that that in depth yet. I know like, um, that you can kind of replicate it by doing like a short, a very short interval and then a slightly longer one. Um, and then like another one where like at the end one, that last one will kind of indicate what it is. Uh, and so you're doing less of it to get the same answer to the question. But sometimes I think when it's someone who's new, I'd rather them just do a 12 minute time trial because it's easy for them to execute in the sense that it's pretty clear. You do a warm up, you do some strides, maybe some dynamic stretches, and you just run as hard as you can for 12 minutes as evenly paced as you can manage. And, uh, I mean, if the, if it's going to produce the data I'm looking for, uh, and I mean, it's also no matter what happens, they'll produce the data. Yeah. I mean, you can, you can screw it up. I guess you can go way too fast. Then you have this scenario where like, Oh, it looks like your, you know, your first two minutes were drastically faster than your last two. And then it's like, Oh, we maybe screwed that one up. But, um, but I mean really like you don't even need to do the time trial technically. Um, a lot of times you can go off of feel like what we described with, um, the threshold stuff and, and, you know, it's a high enough intensity where, where like you can start to kind of like your, your body's going to kind of limit you to a degree where, um, if I said we didn't do the time trial and just started doing the intervals, we could figure out that, you know, if they're doing them right or not, if we see a scenario where, Oh, it looks like these first two intervals were significantly slower than the last two chances are, we're still not quite dialed in in terms of what the intensity is that you should be targeting for those. And as you do a few of them, you just get to know the pacing of it a little better. And then you start seeing more even split. So like, you know, their first two minute intervals pretty close within a couple seconds of their second, or, you know, I guess we'd be looking at distance if we're doing time. So like you went approximately the same distance on that last one as you did the first one. And then we're just looking for improvement over time. So, you know, we might spend four, six weeks kind of focusing on improving that we're going to still include kind of foundational running volume where you're going to be running like an easy pace and enjoyable pace kind of in the interim. And then there's going to be some rest days and that's going to be where the levels come in. My like level one plans are going to be like four day a week training plans. Level two are going to be five day level three are going to be six day with one day off. Um, and you can obviously operate outside of those, those, those are just the ones that I put up for the readymade when I'm coaching people kind of personalized. We just, we look at like what their history is with running their schedule, all sorts of stuff. Cause oftentimes people get hung up on like, well, what are the elites doing? What are the professionals doing? What are the Olympians doing? It's like, well, it's like what the Olympians are doing is they're waking up and they're living and breathing everything around this one race that they're going to do in four years. Or so it's like, we need to step away from that. If you're working, you know, 10 hours a day and you got kids and all this other stuff too. So, um, there's a lot of variables that make it more interesting to coach someone who's actually like not an elite athlete or someone who's a professional athlete, I should say, uh, the, but, but yeah, so they're, they're going to do that stuff. Those, those shorter intervals, um, for probably about like four to six weeks. If they're doing, if they're doing a longer race, like a hundred miles, if they were doing say a 5k, we'd start bringing those workouts in near the end of their plan. Cause that's going to be specific to their race pace. That's going to be the intensity that maybe they're doing for, you know, like a three K or a five K or something like that. So it's going to be more relative to what they're going to use. So it follows that philosophy. The plans follow that philosophy of weaknesses and least specific stuff early. And then we start phasing closer to most specific stuff and strengths as you get kind of near to the end of the plan. And then the distance of, or the time that you're going to spend out doing whatever event it is, is going to dictate how those kind of get ordered in there. I wonder if I could ask you for some sort of advice, maybe almost, uh, maybe look at me as a case study of a particular runner and runner and then see how we can plan stuff out. So which context to give. Okay. So I have been, first, let me say how much we're currently in Austin. I want to say how much I love Austin for many reasons. Uh, first and foremost, people are super kind and just like, there's so much love that I've experienced immediately when I came to the city versus many of the other cities I've been in. It's, uh, it's not quite as welcoming and full of kindness immediately. I mean, I really love, love it here in Austin. And because I've been going through a bunch of stressful stuff, I just kind of gave myself a chance to say, okay, I'm going to stick to a diet of carnivore, keto, but I'm going to eat as much as I want because, uh, primarily because just barbecue was part of the love I was getting here. And I was like, either I resist or just give in. And I decided to give in and actually use this as an opportunity to relax and have fun for the past three, four months, plus whiskey and so on. And then the training kind of all, I also let go of the training a little bit, just to relax, to really focus on the work, focus on the love I've been getting all those kinds of things. But now I just kind of want to set a goal for myself to get back into both competing and grappling, but also doing a, um, hanging out with David Goggins and, uh, doing a conversation with him, but almost this is my own personal kind of race that I'm looking forward to. And in terms of distance, that means running with David, uh, something like a marathon plus plus it's like, it's unclear what plus. So my goal would be to, uh, continue eating carnivore, which is a whole nother topic that I'd love to talk to you about. I feel great psychologically, sort of in terms of mental performance in my work when I eat carnivore and physically, I love it. I've never felt any kind of need for carbs to, uh, to improve performance in my running or anything else. Combine that with fasting, intermittent fasting, or eating once a day. I just, that's when I, uh, feel the best. What else? I also feel best. And this is something you can push back on. I feel best when I just run every day, like no breaks ever, and usually the same way every day. So like, I know this is suboptimal. It'd be interesting to hear your opinion of just how suboptimal that is. Uh, so I think that actually lays out like where my mind is. I'm happy eating carnivore once a day. I like running every day. Uh, the goal is to run a marathon in two months ish, two months plus, and then about three months to do a bunch of competitions and grappling. Okay. With those parameters, I think like you actually probably would be a great candidate for maximum heroic function training strategy. Like you want that consistency where I'm going to do the same thing each day. Uh, you don't want to beat yourself up so much any one day that you can't get out and do it the next one. That's the sweet spot with maximum heroic function is the, the, the trademark there is that you, you can keep going and keep doing it again and again and again, because as long as you're not, you know, going out one day and trying to do twice as much as what you're ready for, for that one specific, the key for you is going to be picking the right starting point and then building from there on what that day kind of entails in terms of how much running you do. So, um, where you could maybe get creative would be if you decided that it's a hard, fast rule that you run an hour every day, seven days a week. But we find out that to run your maximum robot function means you probably are better off sticking to 30 minutes. Then what you would maybe do is you would run underneath your maximum aerobic function for the first 15 minutes in the last 15 minutes, maybe throw some of those strides in there if you want to do that at the very end. Uh, and then that middle 30 minutes is going to be maximum road function target. And then maybe after, you know, four weeks, you start noticing, you know what, this 30 minutes isn't wearing me out near as much as it used to. Um, I feel like I could easily push past that. Well, let's up that to 40 minutes. So that 60, you're always staying within that 60 minute parameter that keeps your, your schedule consistent, your routine consistent. I'm wearing a heart rate monitor to sort of as I run to monitor it. Sure. You could do that. You could go perceived effort. Um, I like to use them in tandem in the sense that like early on, I'll maybe look at my heart rate a little more often, especially for shorter length. There is heart rate can get messy the longer you go. So I, I end up kind of maybe stepping away from heart rate a little more than some will at a certain point because I'm ultimately I'm going to be usually training or working with someone to run like, you know, a race that's really long and they get cardiac drift, dehydration, heat and things that are going to make the heart rate super messy. Yeah. But you're probably your ability to measure perceived effort is exceptionally good. Mine is actually really weak. Okay. Heart rate then I need to do the, still the work of connecting heart rate to the perceived effort. Yep. And that's exactly what I would use heart rate for then. And you'll get to a point probably by like in the first couple of months where you, you can still lean on heart rate if you want, but it'll be kind of one of those things where you keep looking at, you're like, Oh wow, I can guess it. And you play a game with yourself too. And you say, well, how close can I guess? You'll get it. So like for me, what I'll do is I'll do the run and then I'll look at the heart rate afterwards and be like, Oh cool. I was right there. Or I remember feeling like I was speeding up a little bit there and their show is right there on the heart rate or. I also love sort of something we haven't talked about. I love pushups and pull ups of like body weight workouts. Again, it's mostly mental. I just enjoy the mental challenge of it. I also like, it makes me feel like if all I'm doing is running, it makes me feel I'm not like. One dimensional. Yeah. One dimensional. I mean, there's some aspect to running that's not to be like hippie about it, but like, you know, you're, you're with nature, you're running in the, it's like, we're born to do this thing. And that same way, I feel like when I'm doing pushups and pull ups, I feel like I was born to do that kind of stuff. Like it's like this body weight exercise that is, body weight exercises have that way about them. It's, it doesn't have that dumbbell feel or doing bench press or squats, squats with weight. When you're just doing squats, body weight, we do pushups and pull ups, body weight, even just basic ab stuff, core stuff, body weight. I don't know. I just love the way I feel doing that. So it's usually, I forgot to mention that part. I combine that with the running afterwards, doing some basic body weight stuff. Yeah. And I think like you're going to get from, if we're not looking at it from like specifically, like training at a pace in order to get both the skeletal muscle adaptations, as well as the cardiovascular benefits, you're probably tapping into some of the higher intensity stuff with that body weight. So this, and unless you're doing, I guess no rest. Okay. So is it, you get pretty high heart rate from that. Yeah. Very hard. Okay. Higher than running. Yep. So you're checking that box there from just like a lifestyle, enjoyment, fitness, overall fitness standpoint. I think you want to keep your running more aerobic then because you're getting that and you're probably getting it from like your grappling workouts too, I would guess. So there's just not as big of a need for you from a big picture standpoint to be doubling down on that stuff with your runs as well. And it sounds like you prefer not to. Yeah. That's right. So I mean, what about the distance of marathon versus a hundred miles? Is that a big difference? What's a good goal to work towards? Is it marathon and the rest of it just takes care of itself? Yeah. So you want to do a marathon and then ultimately do a hundred mile after that? Is that what you're saying? I have no idea what the guy. Oh, so he's going to tell you spot on what you're doing. So you have to be ready for anything. For anything. Right. My own personal goal is to feel somewhat challenged, but comfortable running a marathon. The longest I've ever run is 22 miles, but there's been many stretches of my life where I would regularly run. Like the long run would be close to 20 miles. And then I was comfortably running 10 miles four months ago. Feels like forever ago. Until I injured myself a little bit by running in the snow and stubbing my toe to where it was like, you don't realize how much you appreciate your toes until you stub them. That big toes where all that power comes off. And so it was surprising how long it took to heal and how essential it was and how unpleasant running, how much I hated running with it. And then I kept like coming, trying to get back out there to run to think, I think it's okay. And no, it's not okay. You really need to let it fully heal. At least that was my experience. I couldn't like just suck it up. It was making it worse every time. And one of those injuries that could really feel, even though it's so small, but it's essential. So is there any difference between the goal of marathon or a hundred miles? Would you say, should I be prepping for a hundred miles if that's at all a possibility? The big difference is going to be like you're dropping intensity significantly by going up to a hundred miles versus the marathon. So the maximum aerobic function I think is actually going to feed into that maybe a little bit better. It's probably gonna be a little closer. It all varies a bit because people will focus on specific distances and they'll get very efficient and very adapted to that. So it's what makes running kind of messy where you'll get, for example, the average person can hit their lactate threshold for probably about 60 minutes or something like that. Whereas you get these elite marathoners who've been basically spending their entire life preparing for a marathon race. They can push almost up to their lactate threshold and after lactate threshold for almost like two hours. So it gets a little messy when you start looking at it from that lens, but you're, you don't really have to worry about that too much because you're not really focusing on being the best possible hundred mile or the best possible marathon. Or you could be, you want enough overall fitness that you can just do either one of them without absolute misery because you did the couch to a hundred miles. So I think like for a hundred miles, the biggest difference I think given your context is just like the more physical things you are doing, the better prepared you're going to be for the hundred mile. So it's almost given your context. I wouldn't say irrelevant. You want to be doing running, but you're going to be doing that. Once you put it in your program, it sounds like it's going to be pretty locked in. If you view it this way, it's probably going to be more mentally beneficial to where, Hey, today I did my run. I did my body weight exercises. I did some grappling practice. You know, I spent three hours working out today. If you think of it like that, then you know, you're, you're moving your body, you're doing things that are active for a good chunk of the day, especially relative to most people. So that's going to actually be very helpful for you. Uh, the, the problem or the, the, the battle to get over is going to just be like the, you know, you're going to break down physically running a hundred miles and you're gonna break down physically running a marathon too. So like the, you might just have to push through a little more discomfort, like from a physical standpoint compared to be a few decided I'm gonna do everything I can in these next like 24 weeks to be able to run a, a full hundred, a hundred miler. Would you say it's physical or is it mental discomfort? Like, uh, I mean, isn't everything physically uncomfortable? Like what, uh, do you train for if you're training for the chaos of, uh, so it's not necessarily the hundred miles. It's the chaos of the unexpected, which might include a hundred miles, but it might also include a thousand pushups in my case. So like, you need a bit jack of all trades is what you need to be. But also like building up the confidence or maybe not. I don't know. How do you survive a thousand pushups? It's combination of confidence that you have to know that you can do that kind of thing. Not necessarily the actual number, but like doing crazy stuff. And the, the second is probably the base strength and endurance and also just the practicing that process of not quitting. I feel like that's one of the things I really need to do in the running space is like doing slightly unpleasant things where I'm yeah, practicing that, like bringing my mind back and saying, Nope, uh, I'm going to keep doing it. And part of the running every day has that benefit because some days you really don't want to feel, don't feel like running and doing that. Then you're practicing that muscle of, um, of doing it anyway. Um, I don't know if there's something you can say in terms of advice, how to practice the, like doing something unpleasant every day frequently. Yeah. What I would do with that is I would try to make the unpleasant thing be different from one day to the next if you can. So the fear I would have with making running unpleasant every time would be, it becomes like a negative feedback loop in your physiologically potentially as well as mentally, where if the entire running process is miserable, you're going to be miserable when you step on that starting line, whether it's a marathon or a hundred miles. So you've trained yourself that running equals miserable. Well, and here's the thing. Like if you look at just like, here's where the literature says on paper are like the dozen workouts you should do in a training plan. And this is how you should structure them right down to the minute. And you just say, like, I'm going to give everyone this schedule and they're going to do this every time rinse and repeat. My biggest concern with that approach is you are potentially putting them in a position where the training is so boring and so monotonous that like if they hit a roadblock mentally, they're going to fall apart very quick because they've already exhausted themselves mentally, just trying to do the same old interval every time doing the same old workout. And it doesn't necessarily have to be like one specific plan in its entirety could just be like, like the, the mix of things within it. So like, rather than like, if I just said, do, oh, we're going to do three minute intervals, this entire short interval process or two minute intervals or four minute intervals or 62nd intervals, you know, by that sixth week, they might be so sick of that, that they're not actually maximizing their potential within that because there's no flavor there. And, and then they're also actually getting less out of themselves than they would if we just got a little more creative and said, okay, let's mix this up and let's do, uh, you know, for one minute intervals, then take a little bit of a break and then we'll do three minute intervals or at least changing it up from week to week so that they have something different showing up, even though we're addressing the same kind of physiological adaptation. Uh, so like, I think what you want to do is you want to introduce the misery. You want to be able to test yourself to the degree where like, when you can recognize these points of, I don't want to be here, but I can do it and push through it, but recognize that like, there's not necessarily going to be one event that you want to lean on to get that from because you won't want to make that one event so miserable that you don't want to do it when it comes time for the challenge. So if you can possibly say like, okay, on Tuesdays, the pushup workout, I'm going to go 10 pushups more than I want to. I'm going to get to that point where I'm like, there's no more. And then I'm going to do 10 more and you're going to make that one miserable. And then maybe on, uh, you know, Thursdays you decide to do like some of those sprints or something at the end where you do a few of them and you're like, okay, this is where I'd be comfortable to stop. Like, well, I'm going to do two more of them because I know I don't want to do two more of them, um, but mix that up. So you're not, so at least you're getting enjoyment from some of it and not just getting complete disgust from the entire process. There's actually quite a lot of ways that I can introduce misery into the running, get creative, including, um, you know, even just like stuff outside of the running, like taking a freezing cold showers, those kinds of things, just introducing random kind of chaos into the, into the system, um, or having conversations with people as an introvert. It's terrifying. More podcasts. So, um, now starting, uh, the training and, uh, Zach, you've been kind enough to also kind of, um, be willing to help me out throughout this process. So I look forward to where that goes. It's kind of, uh, fascinating. Um, on the diet side, you're, uh, one of, one of the many things that, uh, make you fascinating is, uh, you've played with diet as well and you're, um, somewhat famous, I would say, for doing low carb or playing with low carb or meat based diets. Can you describe the potential, like how you're thinking about that has evolved and the potential beneficial role of a carnivore diet or keto diet or a meat based diet in training as an ultra marathon runner? Yeah. And I think like where a lot of times things get confusing for people here is the context of it too, where it's like, they want an answer as to what do I eat for endurance sport? And it's like, well, endurance sport is quite wide ranging as we've talked about many, many times here. So there's going to be differences, I think, in just like what you want to maybe necessarily prioritize, uh, both for the event you're doing and the intensity that's required for it, the training that's required for that event. And then also the individual component too, where I think this one often gets overlooked, where we tend to say like, well, we've got all these Olympic medalists at the marathon and below distance who are, you know, eating a moderate to high carbohydrate diet. So everyone needs to do that if they want to reach their potential in, you know, say the three K to the marathon. And, you know, in a perfect world, maybe that would be true, but there's a lot of other variables that often get forgotten then that could positively or negatively impact that decision choice. So I think Dr. Jeff Volk has done a great job of kind of highlighting this in the sense that, you know, when he works with people, he works with people in the health sphere as well as the performance sphere. And, you know, he's one of the main guys at Virta health who's, uh, they've got like a 60% success rate with working with folks with the type two diabetes to, um, reverse their type two diabetes. Uh, and I mean, that's an astounding, when you, when you think of just any nutritional protocol, its success rate, they're all incredibly low. They're very, very low. And the big difference with his is the coaching aspect of it. Like the give support. So these people like have someone to turn to when they make a mistake, or if they're thinking about doing something differently, or they don't know what to do rather than just kind of throwing, throwing it all up in the air and quitting. They, they, they have a resource there. And that's probably a big reason why that's the success rate that they have with that, is they put those support mechanisms in place. That picture needs to be carried into the performance world or the running world too, where, you know, we may have just been identifying that, uh, you know, Olympic distance athletes that can tolerate a very large portion of their diet coming from carbohydrate is going to just, it's going to filter those ones towards the Olympics filter those towards interesting. Yeah. And that doesn't mean that like, uh, if we would have taken say the gold medals in the five came, put them on a low carb diet, they'd run faster. They probably wouldn't, because we may have already selected that that person's thriving on carbohydrate. Uh, what I would be interested in is like, you have, let's say we have someone with equal talent, but got weeded out along the way potentially because for whatever reason, they just weren't able to tolerate like the, both the training and the nutrition requirements that they're being told to do. So the coaches can, there's a culture where the coaches would really push a carb heavy diet and that that would in itself would do the filtering process of people that are not, it would filter out the people that are not able to tolerate carbs as part of their training. I mean, I might be an example of this actually where, you know, you take someone where, uh, they, for whatever reason, the carbs aren't working for them. Like it's unsustainable for them to continue that path. Or if they do, they might have a shortened career, so they might be able to eke out a few really good years, but then, you know, they're not going to be the person they're like, wow, that person's 38 and they're still competing at the Olympics type of a person. Uh, and, you know, you, you, you put them on a low carb diet, uh, if you can control everything else, like their entire lifestyle is based around training and racing, then, uh, you know, they may still have better potential by introducing carbohydrates at a higher level. But if that's not going to, if that's not going to be sustainable for them as a person, then, you know, what's the point kind of at that, unless they want to be like a kind of a spark in the pan, so to speak. I just feel good eating meat performance wise. Well, I think there's that group too. And they may just not be the Olympians. Yeah. And so we're not talking, I guess this conversation has several layers. One is for the Olympics and one is for like, what is it? Active athletes that are like amateurs, whatever, whatever category I put myself into, like people that exercise regularly. And then, um, maybe people, and then there's people who like exercise rarely. So on all of those fronts, I mean, do you think it's possible to live a happy, uh, active life eating meat only or mostly meat? Yeah. What have you learned about this? Yeah. I think, uh, so for, for some context, like I followed what I would call a low carbohydrate diet for the last 10 years. And just like kind of the training, I periodize it to a degree where there are parts of my training where I do bring back a little more carbohydrate. And there's periods of my training, especially like the off season where I'm like very low and I might be like kind of in that ballpark of, uh, like, you know, ketogenic, strict ketogenic or no carbohydrates for, for periods of time. And what kind of food are we talking about? What's a strict low carb diet? I've ranged everywhere from like mostly plant based, low carb keto to like mostly animal based. I very rarely gone much more than like two weeks strict where it's like I'm strict carnivore or strict plant based or anything like that. Like we're talking probably more like 95% at the, at the peak. Um, in terms of any type of like, like longer lasting, uh, from my personal experience of like being like either in like the animal food camp or her, like the plant based camp kind of a, of a process. Um, so I've tried all of them, things that stayed consistent over the 10 years as a kind of the macro nutrient profile that I've done throughout the course. So one didn't win over the other in terms of meat based versus plant based. Oh, for me, meat based, definitely. What was, I mean, I was, I was my highest meat consumption in 2019 and that was by far my best racing season. Yeah. We keep, we keep coming back to that year. That was a good year for many reasons, philosophically and nutritionally. Yeah. Well in 2020 happened and now I haven't had a really good chance to, to, uh, to improve. We'll see. Hopefully I've got some more, some more in the tank. That's strange. There's so most athletes that compete at your level have more carbs integrated into their diets. So what have you learned about using meat in a high performance? I think it's maybe less about the meat and it's more about like, what are you, what is it replacing? So if we go, if we step away from like me specifically and just like the people that, cause I mean, we're getting to the point where I get it's anecdotes, but like, like that's what we have at the moment. Cause there's, I mean, there is actually a study being done on, like, I think I guess they'd call it hypercarnivore where they're like, I think above 80% of their intake from meat. Um, and they're looking at a few different things there, but it's so weird and I keep interrupting, but it's so weird that it sounds unhealthy, uh, hypercarnivore. Yeah. But it makes me feel really good. So I, that's the individual thing, right? There's countless people now who like, and I'm not saying that they could not have found another route, myself included, like in 2011, when I switched from moderate to high carbohydrate to low carbohydrate and saw some very noticeable differences in the way I felt, the way I performed in all this stuff, that doesn't mean that there wasn't another path. I just did not find that path. And the, the, the fact that I found a path that was producing the results I was looking for is really all that matters in my mind. You know, like I don't really care if there was a parallel path that works just as well or, you know, something like that, because ultimately we only have one shot at everything we're doing. So like, it'd be great if I could go back and try four or five different things. Well, the annoying thing is that the body adjusts to whatever the heck you're doing. So you can't, it's hard to do good science even on yourself. Yeah. I've referenced my 2019 racing season a few times and it's like, it'd be silly for me to put all of the emphasis on my nutrition plan for that, because it's also comes with two decades of endurance training. So it's possible and it's it's possible. And it's very likely that a huge portion of that success was just the culmination of a lot of work over time from the training side of things. I just think like anytime you hyper focus on one area or pick a couple of variables and just target those, you find yourself in a position where you are, you're putting other things in the most uncharitable light possible. So, so then you have this situation where like, it's actually a combination of a variety of different things. So where are the big movers? And you know, for me, nutritional shift was pretty clear that that improved my sleep and my recovery. And I mean, people can say, well, there's the placebo effect, which is a very real concern. But you know, for me personally, a 10 year placebo effect would be a quite lengthy placebo effect. And I do think it's individual, though I emphasize that a lot because I mean, I've worked with tons of people with this and I do see a range from person to person. I've worked with people who come to me and they're like strict keto and we raise up their carbohydrates a bit. And they're like, okay, I feel way better doing it this way. And I've worked with people who they come to me moderate carbohydrate, but they're interested enough. They want to try a lower carb. So we, you know, we titrate them down and I've had clients where I'm like, okay, I'm gonna give them this workout. And they're gonna wish they brought back a little bit of carbohydrate. And then they go and they nail the workout. And I'm just like baffled that because because they're different from me. And every time, you know, when you have your own personal experience, the first guttural response is, oh, if I had done it, it would have gone this way. Why did it go the complete opposite way for them? And you kind of have to just kind of step out of your own perspective a bit and say like, okay, well they're different, you know, for whatever reason they're getting, getting along like this. I've had like several moments in my life where you kind of realize the body is weird and it's weirder than the average advice. Like one of them is how well I perform for my own standards when I fast. First of all, intellectually, but that's more known and understandable. But like physically, the fact that I could train, like not eat 20 hours, 24 hours, and then do a hard like jiu jitsu session for like two hours, like hard. It's incredible to me. Like this makes no sense. Cause I used to eat like many times a day. Of course you have to eat, like you don't want to eat too close to the training session was my thinking, but you definitely need to load up on carbs like three hours before they can, in order to have enough energy. The fact that I could not eat and have like incredible focus, but also athleticism, like both endurance and explosive. I mean, jiu jitsu is a special thing. It's like more like chess. It's not like powerlifting, no, not powerlifting, Olympic lifting, where it's like true explosiveness, but that's fascinating. And it makes me wonder like, what other things are there to discover about yourself? The annoying thing about food is it's delicious. And so it's hard to do good science on yourself, like to do, you know, for two weeks or a month to do like strict no carbs. And then maybe next month you add 20 grams or 40 grams of carbs and see how you actually feel. Not like in that moment, but over a period of several weeks and then doing everything else right with based on best available science, like with electrolytes and then vitamins, but then also like remove all the humans from your life that affect you positively or negatively. Cause you might feel amazing because you're hanging out with cool people and then, you know, like removing basically all the variables. It's kind of fascinating. And you kind of, all of us land in a place where we find something that worked for us. And then we maybe use some of the placebo effect to help us out, to stick in that place. And then I suppose that's the way to live life. I guess it's impossible to find the optimal for any of us, but carnivore is an interesting new kind of caveat, a new challenge to the nutritional community, because more and more people seem to be doing well under carnivore. Yeah. Well, the nutrition community is probably like, we just got done like dealing with the vegans and now we got this opposite end of the spectrum coming at us. But I think, well, I mean, what this all tells, what this all tells me is like, there is a, for one, like in our food environment, like the failure rate of any one approach at a population level is going to be incredibly high. I mean, it's why we have, you know, what is it like 88% of the population has some sort of like metabolic syndrome. And it's, it's like, you know, it's because there's an endless quantity of everything that you can get your hands on for relatively cheap. And I think that's, that, that presents a problem. If your mindset is going to be, we need this set of parameters for nutrition and everyone needs to adhere to that or you're wrong. And it's like, well tell that to the person who like went carnivore and cleared up some like crazy skin ailment or something like that. That's a weird one. Like where the carnivore seems to treat like, like depression, like mental stuff. It's fascinating. There's all these stories. Again, it's anecdotes, but it's like the mental one, I think may, I'm stepping out a bit on a limb here, but I want to say like some of the research of Dominic DiAgostino and Jeff Volokh was looking at the ketogenic diet, which of carnivore diet is basically going to be a part of a ketogenic. I mean, you could always go like way too high on the protein, I guess, but most people that I see doing carnivore, they're cognizant enough that at least if they're doing it for therapeutic reasons, they're not going like, you know, 50% protein, 50%. They're more like 70, 30, 80, 20, something like that. And, and I think like you, you do see some, some work with like the brain. So the mental stuff, I know some of the, I'm not sure if this was part of the DARPA funding that, that Dr. Dominic DiAgostino had where they were looking at things like mental stuff, like post traumatic stress disorder and that sort of stuff with, with like a strict ketogenic diet. So I wonder if some of that, like the depression related stuff has to do with that, where now like their body is just fueling their brain differently than maybe they were in the past, but that's just, you know, wild guesses on my part. And I'm deviating from the conversation, but like, no, that's brilliant. In terms of your own story on food, can you say something? I think we were kind of referring to diet broadly. Can you say something about how you like to fuel your like, whether it's race or great training sessions, like maybe the day before, let's go even that far during, and maybe a few hours after. Okay. It'll be a little different for racing than it will be for like a big workout, just because the interesting thing about ultra running is just like, you never do the race even like most endurance races, you're going to cover the distance. You're going to replicate the race almost up to it in training. Whereas with a hundred miles, you can't, you might replicate a third of it. So, so I'll do, I'll walk you through kind of my approach for, for like a hundred mile race. And I can tell you maybe what I would do differently on like a training day. But yeah, so for where, where the community is an agreement is that you do want to be very good at burning fat for ultra marathons. I mean, there's just like the intensity is low. If your, if your ratios are skewed very high towards carbohydrate metabolism, then you're going to have to defend your muscle glycogen through tons of carbohydrate consumption. And that's just going to be very hard to do over the course of an entire day, even at low intensities. So it's a fuel tank thing. I mean, it's like your, your leanest endurance athletes have way more fat than they do. Glycogen stores. When you're doing the low intensity performance, you want to be burning high levels of fat and sparing that muscle glycogen. What I tend to do is I want to start the race burning really high levels of fat. So I'm going to, I'll maybe have some carbohydrate the night before for dinner, but then I'm going to lean into the overnight fast breakfast the morning of I'm going to stay away from carbohydrates for a hundred mile or anyway. And I'm going to have something like something that's pretty like a high energy, low volume. So like I'll do like an S fuels, a life bar. They've got like, what's in an S fuel life bar? Are we talking about carbs or we're talking about protein fat and protein? Yeah. Fat protein bar. And then they make some awesome. Yeah. So it's, it's not as low carb. Yep. Yeah. They make S fuels makes a whole product line. That's like kind of positioned for a low carb athlete. So they have some products on their lineup that offers some carbohydrate, which is perfect for me because I do introduce some carbohydrate on racing and some of my bigger training sessions and things, but the majority of their products are low carb. So like they have like, you know how you get like the powders that you put into like your drinks that are like high carbohydrate, you know, sports products. They make a version of that. That's like fat based. Oh, cool. That you can mix in with water. Yep. Cool. Yeah. So they've got like a creamer version and then a fruity flavored version. So you can like replicate the taste and the feel of drinking like a, like, you know, a sports drink. Science is awesome. I know it is. Well, and that's so much of it too, cause people are always like, well, I don't know. I just, I just like to have my Gatorade or whatever. It's like, well, you can have it now. It just, it won't have all that. So you can bring that kind of thing with you. Yeah. So I'm leaning on a lot of those like kind of liquid calories, like those low volume, high energy fat protein stuff the morning of so that when I start the race, my body's going to be encouraged to start out burning high levels of fat. Once I get going probably about 45 minutes in, I'll start introducing small amounts of carbohydrate. So at that point, my body's been revving pretty high fat metabolism and by introducing some carbohydrate in the context of the, you know, let's say my a hundred mile, uh, personal record, you know, I'm, I'm running approximately nine miles every hour. So I'm probably going through about a thousand calories in an hour's time. Uh, I'm going to start just like defending muscle glycogen by burning super high levels of fat at the heart rate I would do for that. I'm probably burning somewhere between 80, 90% fat, you know, 12 hours of that you can chip away at your muscle glycogen, uh, to the point where you don't necessarily want to go zero carb. So I'm basically just trying to defend what I know I'm going to be burning from the carbohydrate side of that 80 to 90% fat, 10 to 20% carbohydrate by taking in like, usually, you know, I've gone as low as about 15 grams of carbohydrate per hour and as high as 40 grams. Um, and the reality is somewhere in between is probably the sweet spot, but 40, I can get away without any digestion issues. So I'm not really concerned pushing up to that during a race since I'm only concerned about performance on that day, the carbs, the problem, or is it fiber? Oh, from going above 40 grams or just cause you mentioned digestion issues. Like one of the things for me, like one of the cool things about fatty protein protein and fat is like my stomach just feels way better. So like carbs introduce like bloating and just not feeling great. Yeah. And I think the funny thing is like, if you look at the position paper for ultra marathon single day events and it's, you know, it's very limited in the sense that then it's not anyone's fault. It's just, we don't have a lot of great research on a hundred mile race. It's really hard to study what's going on when someone's running a hundred miles, but they'll say moderate carbohydrate diet is recommended, but they'll also say that it's like something like 60% of participants are going to report some sort of like digestion issue during the event. So then it kind of becomes an issue of, do you want to flip that coin? Do you want to flip that coin and be the 40%. Right. Exactly. So for me, what I found is like, I can push up to 40 grams without getting any digestion issues. Um, do I need 40 grams? Probably not, at least not based on kind of the numbers that would be like, uh, that, that I would see on, like if I went and actually got a, like a metabolic heart test or something like that. Um, but it's possible. I mean, if I had a really good race that I would get close to burning that per hour, um, most folks that are following a moderate high carbohydrate diet are going to be recommended to do like 50 to 70 grams during a single day ultra marathon events. And you'll see some, you know, some recommendations of up to like a hundred grams, uh, not so much for ultra marathons, but just in general, from like a performance standpoint, which I mean, it's one of those things where it's like application versus like what you can do in a lab for one hour is going to be a lot different, especially when you're stretching out distances well past that. And you, you, there's, there's, I'm diverting a little here, but I mean, there's like an approach of like training your gut so you can like be able to tolerate that much carbohydrate, which you can do, and you may have to, if you're going to follow a high carbohydrate diet. But again, we go back to that practicality standpoint of if you're a professional Olympian who's living and breathing performance and you're burning two to three times, you're messing, resting metabolic rate on some days, like you, you may be able to actually consume a hundred grams of carbohydrate per hour during your training sessions and, and just, you know, barely stay on top of your nutritional needs. Most people who are running ultra marathons aren't going to be, you know, probably training much past 10 hours per week. And they're probably not going to have the, I'll call it their, a dietary budget to tolerate a hundred grams of carbohydrate consumption during their workouts and still be able to stay healthy. And, you know, so I think that's kind of like a, a bit of a, of a non, a non starter for the majority of people, unless we want to talk about like a tiny percentage of the 1% of top performers. So maybe you can talk about the training, like fueling yourself during training as well. Is there, and also as part of that, is it possible to train mostly fasted? Because as a side comment, let me just say, I like, again, not anywhere, not even like one 10th of your level of performance, but you know, I, I try to push myself and I just feel much better when I'm fasted. So water and maybe some salt for longer runs for anything over like 10, 15 miles, but not no food. Yeah. I think, I mean, I like to train on an empty stomach. I do most of my, my biggest training session usually in the morning. And it usually what will determine whether I eat something or not before that is like, how much do I need to eat that day in order to stay on top of it, to build training in the next day. So I'll, I'll, I'll usually do something similar to what I do before a race. If I need to kind of stay on top of calories for the day. So I'm not like at noon with like no calorie intake and like 5,000 calories to try to consume before I go to bed that night and get out and do the same thing the next day. But yeah, I think if I were, if I were doing what you're doing, like if that were my lifestyle, I think I would do almost all my runs fasted. I don't see why I would be eating a lot before it because it's like I'm just introducing something that could, especially if you're noticing, like here's what I'd say. If I was doing that and I was like, wow, this run sucks. And then I introduced something beforehand and now my run was feeling great and my progress was getting better. That's when I would maybe consider having something before. But if you're running both of those, those like self experiments, you're noticing, yeah, if I eat something before I go on this workout, the workouts less enjoyable, I'm not noticing any, any increased improvements on it. Again, it's a little messy. Like we said before, it's hard to really, you can't go back and try it a different way on that specific day. But I think, I think most people, if they're just like, they go at it with like no bias in the sense that they're like trying to make one work versus the other, you can get at least a good enough look at it. And if absolute peak performance in one activity, one very specific activity isn't your goal, then it's like, do you really care if one has a 2% performance increase that you won't even probably notice because there's other variables that will clearly overpower that 2% one way or the other. And there's some benefit in terms of freedom and letting go of like having to think about some of these variables. I see sort of fasting as even if it's like a hit on the performance, it's worth it to just not think about it. There's some really nice aspect to just putting on shoes, not caring like what shorts you wear or like what your outfit is, like not being optimal in every way and just not caring and just enjoying the purity of just running no matter what. Just enjoying the natural aspect. There's a side to me that sometimes just like craves a lifestyle where it's like I have like such a small house and only what I need and just like a handful of food products I know I enjoy and work well for me and I don't even have the distraction of the other stuff. There's almost like a weight that comes off your shoulders when you think even just thinking about it like it's so simple. So the reason I'm mostly a minimalist like that, the reason I have that avenue, um, where I think it's maybe to the extreme as if it becomes like your entire life philosophy where like every little thing you do is never quit. But life is short, Zach. Like why? I mean, this is the problem I have. This is probably the programming thing too is over optimization is dangerous. Uh, it's like every once in a while, I mean, you're, you do this kind of stuff. You're not, for example, with a hundred mile run, you're, I mean, you could just be doing that for the rest of your life and do like the most optimal hundred mile run ever, but you keep taking on like new challenges and there's a lot more chaos in that. And there it feels like the muscle of never quit will be much more important than the optimality of your training. Yeah. So there's probably a couple sides to me with that kind of a thing where for one, I think when we talked about the why, so like, I think the why can kind of shift a bit and it probably will if you do something long enough or evolve maybe is a better way to call it, to put it. And for me, like one of my my big drives and one of my big passions within ultra running is to first of all, find an event that I really, really love to train for and participate in. So for me, I feel like I've kind of identified that to a degree and that's kind of runnable hundred milers. So once I found that it became more of a driver for me to see like, well, how fast can I run a hundred miles in a very controlled environment? So let's eliminate weather, let's eliminate, you know, elevation, let's eliminate like having to wait extra long to get crew or support and that sort of thing. And that's how you find yourself on a 400 meter track running a hundred miles. But for me, like the important part of that is that I can control the environment enough where if I come back year after year, I can retest myself and have a decent ability to kind of say I improved or I regressed or I stayed stagnant. And I think that's a big driver for me. But one thing I've recognized within that is if you just keep doing that, like if I could probably pick three flat runnable hundred milers a year and optimally prepare, race, recover and repeat without like burning myself out. But one thing I think I learned also in 2019 was that sometimes you kind of need to step away from some of these really, really kind of important markers in your like your performance or in whatever you're trying to do and take a step away from it and try to do something a little different in order to kind of hit the reset button on just like what I would call just like your mental energy to be able to continue to do it at a high level. So almost like happiness. Exactly. Well, here's the example. Like, I mean, I love running in trails to most people would consider me a flat road track runner, runnable ultra runner. But I like to do trail runs too. So and at the end of two thousand and eighteen, I recognized that I had been kind of pushing the gas pedal on trying to run fast hundred milers for quite a while without really a break in that where it was like, OK, I did one. Now I'm going to take a brief off season, but then I'm going to ultimately build up and peak for another one. I might introduce some fun trail races in the context, but they're going to be races are going to be training races, time on feet type of stuff that are going to kind of mimic like a long run, essentially. And but the main focus always in the back of my mind was like getting on the track and seeing how much faster I can run a hundred miles. And that just kind of that energy that it takes to continually think by that, that I think the motivation to keep that stoke high enough to really meet your full potential fades if you don't step away from it for a little bit. So I took essentially half a year away from runnable stuff and just decided I'm going to prepare for the San Diego hundred mile, which is like a much more elevation, technical trail type of an event. Is that a trail run or no? Yeah. It's a trail hundred miler actually just kind of just outside of San Diego. And yeah, it goes through it goes over part of the Pacific Crest Trail and stuff. So it's very different than running on a runnable surface. So to give you some context, like I ran was I think just under 17 hours for that race, whereas on a flat surface I can run 11 hours and 19 minutes. So just the environment alone added an extra, you know, five plus hours to the day. So it's just a different experience, different skill set. And what it did is it allowed me to kind of step away from kind of focusing on like splits on a track, running flat stuff, like preparing for things specifically for a flat environment and start training for something that's more climbing and descending, more technical running skill sets and things like that. And the cool part about it was, first of all, you know, when you step away from something and after something a lot different, I mean, it's still running. There's still a huge advantage I had from the running I'd done in the past that was going to put me in a good position to be successful. But there was a much higher or a much bigger range of potential improvement for me. So through the like four plus months I spent preparing for that race, you know, I noticed, oh wow, I'm getting faster on this climb or I'm getting better at descending this technical trail. It was one of the most fun races I've run actually. So it was kind of a cool experience. I ended up taking the lead at like 93 miles. So you were racing, racing, like you were trying to get first. So it's still a race. Yeah. So what was the enjoyable aspect of it? I don't think I've recognized it so much while I was doing it actually. It surfaced afterwards. I mean, the enjoyment of the race itself is like when you find yourself in a position where you're sitting in basically second place all day long and then you take the lead at 90, I think it was like 91 or 92 miles. It's like, yeah, that's kind of a cool way to race. But afterwards I recognized a few things just about kind of pacing and you know, how to maybe pace the first half of a hundred miler versus a second half. I also recognized shortly thereafter once I finished or covered and decided my next event was going to be a flat runnable race that, wow, I really was way more excited to do the workouts that I needed to do to get ready to run a fast, flat hundred miler. And I don't think that would have been the case had I just tried to do another flat, fast hundred miler earlier or during that year and end up in a situation where like I maybe had like normalized a suboptimal like outlook on like something that I had just done so many times already. Yeah. And I recognize that it was just every workout I did. I was like, I did this workout a year ago and it was not nearly this much fun. And our, you know, the interesting thing about these track hundreds too, is like you find yourself doing like your peaking phase where you're running your long runs, which for me are usually like, you know, around 30 miles or so, and I'll do them on back to back days. And you know, I try to replicate the environment I'm going to race on. So I'm finding myself on a 400 meter track. And it's like when I started doing that again, I just felt like I was super motivated to go out there Saturday and Sunday and do those back to back long runs and see the progress and then head out again the next week and do it again. So I had some of my more enjoyable long runs, which are going to be the most specific to the race day environment that I had in quite some time. And I think that was really beneficial and kind of putting me in the right spot to be able to push through barriers on race day and put me in a position where quitting was going to be much less of a likelihood, given the enjoyment I had in the months leading into the race itself. Yeah, even the thought of quitting. Yeah. Yeah. So you mentioned the track, you've also ran 100 miles on the treadmill, and the trail 100 mile. Broadly, if we zoom out, what does it take to run 100 miles? For most of the world, that seems like a crazy distance to run. So maybe it's interesting to ask, not only is just setting the world record, but purely running, what does it take to run that far? Yeah, I mean, I think people probably overestimate what it takes in terms of just getting it done. I think this is consistent in just running in general. I think the marathon was always a big one with that where people thought like, well, you have to do this training, or you just literally won't physically be able to complete a marathon. And then we got into an era of kind of like, running as more of an enjoyment thing versus a performance thing. And then you'd have people running, granted much slower. I think if you look at the Boston Marathon average finishing times, it goes from like, or maybe it wasn't the Boston Marathon, it might have been marathons in general, went from like three hours to five hours or something like that. So it's like, people, I think got past the fact that you can only do it if you're optimally prepared to, well, I can do it and maybe not meet my full potential if I'm going to like, not do much training, which I wouldn't necessarily advise. But I mean, I've I've talked to people who basically run 100 miles, sometimes almost off the couch. And it's like, it's, to me, what that says is just the human body is incredible, and what it can tolerate above and beyond what it's been exposed to, if it has to, or if it feels like it has to. So that's the basic sort of getting from point A, from the start to the finish. It's the human body and the human mind is capable of doing it without much preparation. But then you start to increase the goal of performance, and you try to get actually a good, like, the most out of your body that you can. How does that start to change then? Yeah, going from fun to performance? Yeah, I think once you start putting marks or goals on outside of just finishing, that's where it starts getting interesting. Because now you could maybe go on with multiple goals where like, if one falls off due to something that you didn't expect, then you have another one to target. But you can always build those up and try to think like, well, I want to run faster than last time, or I want to, you know, break a course record or an age group record or something like that. And that that I think is just going to be a little bit of a different mindset. Because now you're looking at every little thing from what do I need to do to prepare as well as what I need to do to be efficient on the day itself. So like transitioning aid stations and things like that, or do I want a pacer or not? stuff is I realize like you probably have to fit into society and if you want to have other people in your life you should probably get used to having stuff because most people like stuff. Right. Well yeah there's that side of it too and there's a whole, you don't want to ostracize yourself too much and I think anything you can kind of like you can manipulate that a little bit where there's things that are like not specific to, that's going to negatively impact the people around you or your experiences with them. So there's a balance like everything I guess. Yeah I mean that's why I drink, I think I mentioned you offline, drink vodka, whiskey, sort of alcohol because I don't feel good about it the day after or sometimes multiple days after so I know it's not good for me. So I do a lot of stuff that's good for me, everything we talked about exercise and diet and all those kinds of things but the alcohol almost symbolizes embracing the chaos of life, the wild and the amazing things that could happen and I think that's really important because if you optimize everything about life then you're going to miss most of the fun stuff that happens in life. So it's not all about the optimization, it's some of it like everyone has different things and what they, how they introduce that chaos in a controlled way. For me alcohol is that because I'm okay drinking not too much so I can control that aspect even though it's unhealthy it introduces just the right amount of fun that I embrace it. Yeah and I mean it is one of those things where it's like I'm going to benefit now and pay later a little bit too where like and hey if you go and you go out with some friends and drink and you have memories that last a lifetime from that experience and you paid for it for a couple days after then hey maybe that's a fair trade off from a life experience. And part of the vodka thing is I need to honor my ancestors so it's like you have to you know you can't you can't turn your back on your past. Let me ask about the 100 mile world record on the treadmill. So for most people running a treadmill is really boring so that's kind of their experience of it that's probably the first thing that would say that seems like really boring to run 100 miles in a treadmill. Would you say it's boring? Like what were some places your mind went to make that happen? So this one is interesting to me because I definitely recognized the boredom and the difference. The thing that the question I can't quite answer I think with it is like could I have remedied that with better preparation because the scenario that put me on a treadmill for 100 miles was you know it was March 2020 basically the cascade of every race on the planet got cancelled and I was in a position where I was going to be doing a runnable 100 miler on a track in mid to late April so I had like the majority of my training under my belt so I was like kind of putting the finishing touches on that and I was like oh great here we are like you know what do I do with this fitness? Do I just scale back and hope the events come back in fall and then peak again or do I find something to use this fitness for? And the treadmill was the closest thing to what I had been training for in terms of just like a mechanical like flat running essentially that I could think of and my thought was okay well I'll just live stream myself on a treadmill and see what happens. It ended up turning into like a quite a big event. So you don't usually incorporate treadmill running into your running into your training? I don't not incorporate it. I just don't incorporate it in the way that would be necessarily conducive to uh you know dealing with the mental aspects of being on a treadmill for 100 miles. Was it that different than running on a track? It was from the sense that here's the way I describe it is when I'm on a track it's a controlled environment and everything can be very uniform but there are tiny little micro adjustments and pace that that I'm doing subconsciously that give me the sense of control. Right. No I might run the exact same split but there's like a fraction of a second or you know a fraction second faster than a fraction of seconds slower that equals the same outcome. It gives you that sense of control. You're determining how fast you're going. On a treadmill you're responding to the belt so the advantage is you can set a pace and know you're hitting it. The disadvantage is you're being told what to do by that machine and that gets very frustrating. I've felt like I wanted to step off like you get to like certain points where you're just like like even stepping off what I noticed I learned this on the day of actually I noticed there's something where it didn't really matter how long I get off like I get off to use the bathroom and that was a little bit of a longer break. Then I had like a hiccup during my event where we ran so much power through one end of the house that the screen on the treadmill was blacking out. So I ended up jumping back and forth on treadmills for quite a bit in the beginning and I noticed even turning it off stepping on the other and starting the other one up gave me like you know a handful of seconds between was enough of a mental break of just like that release of being told what to do to reset. So maybe if you were in the future you would figure out what exactly how much is needed to have that mental break. I never actually thought about that that I mean obviously for you but also for people like me like amateur runners that that's a source of frustration with the treadmill that there's sometimes small adjustments in pace that we do running not on the treadmill on the ground that feel like essential. Just like you said that experience of control like feeling like you're in control somehow that's really I don't know that's somehow liberating in the way that a treadmill can be just the source of frustration. The funny thing though about the treadmill is I actually like to do faster workouts on the treadmill like long intervals or something like that or tempo runs because for that type of stuff sometimes for those I want to release the brainpower required to hit that pace and say you take care of that and for that it's fun but those are over quick so you don't really run into the times. Yeah that's fascinating for like precise control of pace. You've also during that stream got to interact one of the greatest athletes of all time, Berg Kreischer. What's your he's actually doing I don't know if you're paying attention to this but I guess he has a goal of running 2,000 miles this year. Yeah. I've got a chance to talk to Joe Rogan yesterday about this which is fascinating. I think he's a little bit doubtful of Bert's ability to be the ultra performer that he so naturally is. Yeah. What's your thoughts about Bert as a runner? What's your advice to him and what was your interaction like as part of this treadmill challenge with him? I love Bert because he's such a nice person. I mean as a guy who's just accelerated in popularity over the last few years like he is like super kind so for folks who are curious like I've met Bert a couple years earlier and I just randomly asked him like hey I'm doing this live stream thing we're doing it for fight for the forgotten we're trying to raise some funds for them would you want to come on the live stream for a bit and I thought maybe he'd come off like five or ten minutes and I thought that'd be amazing if he did that he ended up coming on for like over an hour he said he went past his slot sat in the next slot and just started talking with some of the other guests it's just he's just like Bert is definitely like I feel like he's as unchanged from like his popularity as one can get away with and it's just like his his lifestyle I think is very unpredictable in the sense that like if he wants to run like x time for a specific race that's going to pull away from his lifestyle so much to focus on that luckily for him he's actually a great athlete like you it's it's under that layer of uh of fat yeah so for people who are not familiar Bert Kresch is a comedian who takes off his shirt often has he's a uh uh elegant layer of fat around him he's also a party animal so he's a weird balance of like healthy and unhealthy yeah so he drinks a lot during I think there's some debate about that but certainly after his uh his performances but at the same time he's into kind of the running thing and he does quite a bit of treadmill running I think so and like I said has this challenge of running 2000 miles this year so it's fascinating to have somebody who so fully embraces life and the full joys of life as represented by the huge amounts of drinking and partying and just being a wild man but also at the same time like being at least curious about this challenging yourself in the physical realm it's kind of fascinating it reminds me of um one of my favorite comedians like Eddie Izzard who's been doing those challenges basically off the couch just running um a marathon a day kind of thing it's fascinating to see the purity of those challenges when like exercise hasn't necessarily been deeply ingrained in your life and you kind of just embrace the challenge anyway and take it on and that's another way of looking at it because we've been talking about running as a a performance like optimization thing where training is such a huge part of this process like race day is just the cherry on top but there's for some people where the race is the cake yeah it's like they just take it on as a pure challenge as the as the as the thing you haven't really trained for as the thing you haven't you don't understand the intricacies of but you take it on anyway and that that reveals something about the human spirit as well yeah and there's definitely like a switch that flips when you in your mind is saying i'm going to do this where then all of a sudden it goes from like you stop thinking about oh that's not possible to like well i'm just going to do it and i think Burt highlights that perfectly in a lot of cases where like he's he's maybe not even thinking it through enough to get to the point where it's like he gets the point where he thinks this is not possible where most people would look at it and think huh i don't know if i can actually physically accomplish that task Burt's just like oh yeah i'm gonna do it and my my thought with Burt was the 2000 mile thing where he's like yeah i'm gonna do it and my my thought with Burt was the 2000 mile thing is where are we gonna find him at the end of the year with like 36 hours to go on 100 miles and that's right that's right that's what's gonna happen and it's going to be hilarious uh so speaking of things that are insane and like taking on challenges that don't seem like you didn't you didn't think through uh uh you're thinking about running across the country in in a challenge you call the transcontinental run can you describe this challenge and what the heck you're thinking yeah yeah so this is uh you know one thing that is exciting about ultra marathons i think in a lot of places especially early in someone's ultra marathon adventure if they decide to do that as a you know part of their life is you have like these early years where you're doing things for the first time and it's like so cool and scary at the same time to think today i'm gonna run 100 miles and the first ever run before is 50 or something like that and you just know you're gonna do something that you've never done before you're gonna experience things you would have never been able to predict and it's like this really interesting unique like human experience i think so for me i've spent most of my career at this point like doing i got through that phase and a lot of the events i'm really interested in and then it was like now let's repeat it and see if we can do it better and you get into that mindset for a while which is also a fun mindset but there is that kind of like uh desire to kind of have that human experience again of like you know not knowing what could happen or is this doable type of a thing but still doing it and figuring it out along the way so i would describe the transcontinental project as something like that it's not anything unique to me or anything new there's been a lot of people who've done it before but essentially it's a route there's different routes there's one kind of main one that's done for like the that is used as the record route more or less that you go from san francisco to new york and essentially you live out of an rv uh while you're running so you run as much as you can during the day then you go to bed at night and then you get up and do it again and you're you're handling all the logistics and the process of trying to make sure you can get up the next day and do again what you did the day before which is going to be the biggest difference so for me i've done all single day ultra marathons where you're going to wring yourself dry at knowing the next day or week or however long you need you're going to be able to just kind of like shut everything down and let everything catch back up whereas with this like you know you're doing it again and again again yeah and you know the record is by a guy named p costa who averaged just over 72 miles a day finished in 42 days six hours and 30 minutes and i mean just like 72 miles 73 miles and then like next day again next day again just knowing every day when you finish you spend a whole day running and then okay i'm gonna go to bed i'm gonna wake up in the morning i'm gonna have to do this again and then you know have that happen for six weeks and that's if it goes very well so luck i assume is a big part of this yeah for sure i mean there's just so many variables that are uncontrollable on this type of an experience just because i mean you go over the sierras maybe you hit a storm you know you try to time it most people do it in sep start in september so you can get over the mountain passes without a big storm coming through uh but then also get to the east coast before it's like the middle of winter so like september early september start is kind of ideal but you can you know i mean pete was very fortunate from a weather standpoint i think he made one big mistake he got a little too aggressive beginning had to take a full day off so he actually averaged from a moving day standpoint closer to 75 miles per day um but yeah i mean there's going to be things that i can't prepare for won't know it's going to happen you know a lot of that will get a lot of the logistical stuff will get leaned on with the crew so that's i mean that's the hardest part right now is just like getting all that put together where it's like okay i need to have the rv ready i need to have all the stuff and we need to have the places figured out where we're going to stop and and the people that can you know dedicate that much time to an activity like that you know there's a lot of moving parts even before you start the adventure itself when are you see you're taking the san francisco to new york yeah and when are you doing the the run september 1st is when uh you know barring anything like catastrophic between now and then it's really exciting but i mean this is incredible so you you'll probably have a bunch of people just randomly running with you are people going to be tracking where you're located yeah so i'll be documenting everything because i mean my hope is that i'm doing it primarily to raise awareness for fight for the forgotten justin wren's charity uh but with that said i think i am capable of uh if i have a good experience uh you know chasing the record or going after the record or at least getting close to it so oh shit so you're gonna try to beat this record yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna go out with the i'm gonna structure the process in a way that leaves that door open is the way i would describe it i'm gonna try not to do anything that would potentially put it in a situation where that becomes the primary goal just because i want to make sure that the reason i decided to do in the first place was for fight for the forgotten so i want to make sure that i don't end up two thirds of the way across the country with a broken leg and i'm like hey guys uh i guess the donation button's turned off so focus on like don't sacrifice that right that goal but also there's a community aspect to it that i feel like are you going to i mean so you're going to document and post yeah but are you going to also is there a safety perspective here it's like the forest gum thing you might have large numbers of crowds that run along with you for a while yeah are you worried about that kind of thing i wouldn't say i'm worried about i mean i think there's probably there's remote enough spots along the way where you'll get some alone time more more likely i don't necessarily mind if people want to jump in there'll there'll be some people that will definitely want to do that and and they can come in and but the reality is like it's probably not going to be a scenario where there's like you know 40 people following me at all times you say that now yeah you never know just wait for this podcast yeah and then if joe finds out you're doing this then we're in trouble all right so um i mean what are the things that you think will be the hardest for you and also like how do you train for this kind of thing um and what yeah what are the hardest things you anticipate how do you train for them yeah so the way i'm looking at this is it's much less about performance from the traditional sense where i need to be able to be x fit i think i need to be injury proof that's what's going to be a detriment if you think about it like if i manage to average nine minute mile pace for a day that would be 80 miles in a 12 hour time frame so i'll easily have 12 hours of moving time per day um nine minute pace i think is slow enough that it's not an unreasonable clip so like when you i mean obviously there's things that slow you down or i'll probably take walking breaks you know stopping breaks you got to stay on top of nutrition that's the other big thing too i'm you know probably eating like anywhere between 10 to 15 000 calories a day which is you know i can probably count on my hand a couple of occasions where i've eaten that much in my life so now i got to do that for six plus weeks in a row and you don't want any having a stomach problem i'm trying to try to minimize the amount of stomach problems so you would you estimate about 12 to 13 to 14 hours of running every day yeah that's probably like from from the first step to the last step it'll probably be somewhere around like say 14 hours 13 hours or something like that would be a pretty good estimate and then getting rest and so and then minimizing the risk of injury which could be as small as like like literally uneven surfaces resulting to like stepping the wrong way i mean that's going to be a lot of steps yeah yeah uh huh so the probability of injury are you worried about that kind of stuff is can you strengthen the ankles or those kinds of things that prevent yeah possibility of injury and that's that's where i'm putting a lot of my focus in is i think like just being running fit is going to be like generally speaking is going to be important i'm going to i think just from a lifetime of running is going to be a huge advantage a lot of these like kind of like mechanical movements are going to be very established it's just going to be about can i tolerate that volume of it there i think that i'm doing more strength work i think this is something where it's like you know maybe adding five pounds of lower body muscle is going to be an advantage versus a disadvantage when you're looking at power weight ratio because i just don't really don't i don't i never need to be running a 648 mile for this adventure um and i so i'm looking at that i'm doing a lot more of that stuff focusing on that the training is changing a fair bit where it's more polarizing versus kind of being i mean i've always had some polarization in my training but this is even to an extreme where like i'm going to do some simulations where uh you know i go out and do two or three days where i target the exact thing i will be doing on the transcon you were on instagram posting about these simulated runs so you legitimately like trying to perfectly copy what would happen in one two or three day segment on that run yeah just to kind of start to weed out where are the potential problems so let's say i do a two or three day simulation where i'm averaging 70 miles a day and i find out at the end of three days there's a really weak spot here um i need to address that or i need to find a way to make that not a weak spot i think that's the only way to really get as close as you can to avoiding injury have you done that yet have you done a two day 70 mile like even that's incredibly difficult i haven't yet i'm going to build up to it because that's the other thing too is like i don't think you want to be so aggressive with that where you get injured trying to figure out how not to get injured uh so i'll i'll what i'm going to start what i just started last week is i've uh it looks really weird on my training schedule because like last week i ran almost 150 miles but i took two days off so it's like usually for me to get to 150 miles that's a seven day training week uh so that's the way i'm doing it like i did i did a day where i did uh you know two like just over 20 milers separated with by just a couple hours and within that couple hours i did like a three mile walk the following morning i woke up and ran i think it was like just over 36 miles first thing in the morning just to get an idea of just like kind of like what is it like to be i mean this was in phoenix too so it was 100 degrees for the majority of that just suffer then rest yeah suffer again how that feels there's enough precedent with this sort of an activity where like everyone i've talked to so far has told me like there is going to be like this kind of like gradual decline in the early stages where you're just like okay it's getting worse it's getting worse it's getting worse and you hit a point where you're just like it hits kind of rock bottom and then like it starts to kind of gradually improve so you kind of have to let yourself get it's weird i think i can maybe eliminate i'm trying to find a way to eliminate some of that by doing the simulations whereas i from what i've seen i haven't seen a lot of people do the simulation route yet i've seen people just do like a lot of training and then say like okay i'll spend the first seven to ten days adapting to this and then i'll get comfortable within this environment and be fine whereas i'm going to try to get to a point where like some of that is already kind of cleared up before i start but not so much that i'm like adding like an extra central week to the trip with worth of running what do you think will be the hardest simulator run leading up to like will you do three days yeah i think i'll probably try to do three days somewhere between 70 and 80 miles each will be kind of like the goal will that be in august do you think how close to yeah i would like it to be in august like early august would be ideal i think like maybe the first week in august because that gives me kind of three weeks to let things kind of settle down from that but then it's crazy this is incredible it's it's actually interesting because like if i did let's say i did the simulation now um the problem with that is like the adaptations from just like the breakdown and the strengthening would likely be gone unless i did it again uh so i want to inch up to it so that like and get close enough to the starting date so that i'm still kind of like you know holding on to that adaptation when i start it so then those first few days maybe aren't quite as miserable and you said uh if everything goes amazing and you're challenging the record it'll be like a 42 day run yeah so that's what the record is almost exactly six weeks and that's at 72 and a half miles per day so will you be posting online and like yeah instagram's gonna be a big one i think i might do a few like youtube stuff along the way too um yeah i'm still ironing out exactly how much i think at minimum i'll do i'll do some instagram stuff i think i'll go live on instagram a few times during the day when i take like walking breaks uh partly just to kind of i think keeping people i mean it stays true to the the goal of raising awareness but it also i find when you bring people in there is an added pressure to that but there's also this sense that i've learned from the treadmill experience since we had like a pretty big production for that in the sense that i mean as much as you can turn on a camera in your own house but like the i remember thinking we had like 30 people lined up to come in and guest speak during that and there's points of that where i was like you know you get that voice we talked about the beginning where it's like you know maybe you could quit like you really need to run 100 miles on a treadmill is this really going to be valuable for you and then you think about oh you know what there's uh you know courtney dewalter one of the best female ultra runners to ever exist is taken in the 30 minutes to an hour out of her day to come on in two hours to you know help me you know amplify this event and do i really want to be sending emails out to these people saying hey guys i know you were gracious enough to block out time of your day you know i think there's a little bit of that to do where you're like you're you're you're jumping in with the community that is following along and saying here's how things are going show them the best the worst and everything between and then ultimately have that hold you accountable a little bit too it's like hard to get up in the morning and not go back out i don't know how you are but i had to uh whenever i did any kind of physical stuff like the 48 hour challenge or just any kind of running i hated turning on the camera yeah i hated it like because you have to like smile and be friendly and stuff oh i'm just gonna be super miserable if i'm miserable well that's it so like exactly in some sense that's what people you know we're gonna get a happy zac or an angry exactly it's like you're making bets and i'm sure there'll be some days maybe not many maybe very few where you're truly happy with yourself like for some weird ecstatic reason maybe if you get over the hump whatever that you mentioned that this dip i mean it's it's fascinating how many how much suffering this actually entails i wonder well and one thing i'm gonna definitely try to leverage to my advantage and one of the reasons why i think fight for the forgotten was the charity that really triggered me to decide to do this the transcontinental route was something i learned about early in my ultra running career and i thought to myself i want to do that someday but it was one of those kind of far off distance things that had never really like actualized in your mind until you put a date down or you know mention it on the joe rogan experience or something like that when then it then it's like people want to know when is this happening and uh um you know what i try to think about is you know the reason justin identified the pygmy tribe was because they were super forgotten where you know we think about just like some of these third world countries where it's a scenario of like some people it's easy for us here in the us to think to ourselves well why don't they just industrialize why don't they just like you know start to innovate a bit why are they so primitive what's wrong with them and in reality like when you take uh when you scale things down to the degree where you need the entire day because of the situation you're in just to take care of your basic needs of water and food you never get the opportunity to even build a real like establishment or you know a build on that like you need you need the free time or you need a portion of your population to have the free time available to innovate and the pygmy tribe just hadn't had that historically in fact they weren't even considered humans by like the local government for quite some time and you know the people that really pay the price in some of these situations are the women because they're the ones that get saddled with like the water gathering and things like that so the reason that justin picked wells to build was because he thought to himself if we can get them wells then now these women don't spend all day walking and carrying water now they can just get that water and now we have half the population freed up for other things now maybe they can start farms they can build some housing and stuff like that and it just it exponentially improves once you take care of some of those big key early things so when i'm thinking about like you know do i really need to go out here and travel another 12 hours a day my mind is going to hopefully go to well if one of those women woke up in the pygmy tribe one morning deciding you know what do i really need to go get water today well yeah you do you really do have to yeah you're running for that uh huh yeah and that that will give you fuel hopefully but yeah yeah i mean the reality is always there where i don't have to do it like they do have to do it so you know but i think just keeping that perspective it it puts us back to the beginning where it's this is one of those situations where i think it's like uh a no quit situation you have to put yourself in a no quit situation here because it's uh you know it's just bigger than you i can't wait to see like the dark places you go i mean there's some yeah the the quit situations and hopefully we get to have a glimpse of those because i think those are really inspiring when somebody is uh both gets broken by them because you know how tough you are but also is almost broken and overcomes it i mean that's just fascinating stories i can't wait i i know does joan know you're doing this by the way yeah i sent him i sent him a note a while back because he was the first spot i mentioned it on so i think he knows i'm not sure if he's following along about the exact starting date or not you will know this is great you probably think you're a crazy uh mfr for doing this but uh i think you love it and i think i love it and i think the world will love it ridiculous question who's the greatest endurance runner or endurance athlete of all time oh that's a good question um i think i'd probably go maybe two directions here uh i think uh heli geber lassie is one of the best in my opinion because just i mean 27 world records like like not all the different distance but like braking and rebraking and that sort of stuff um i mean he ran two what was it 203 359 before the shoe technology came in that is estimated at anywhere between a two to eight percent performance advantage i'm talking about a two hour marathon 203 yep two hour three minutes yeah so he did that with the old shoe technology which uh essentially dates back to anything if if you were a nike athlete it could date back to as early as i think early 2016 is when the first prototype started showing up uh so if you're before that in your career you were using you're guaranteed to be using the old shoe technology um and i mean just the range of it too and uh yeah it's it's hard i mean there's there it's uh is he a marathon runner purely no he did everything that's why i pick him i think because he he he went everywhere everything from the 800 and is like at a national level yeah at a national level i don't he wasn't competing at like olympics or anything in the 800 but he was he was mostly like 5k to marathon um yeah yeah so just incredible i mean i i could go a totally different direction too i think like steve prefontaine stands out in as an american runner just because if you look at it outside of just like performances and stuff like that i think um he basically like you can't find an american male runner who probably didn't get some motivation or some catalyst into their running journey from a prefontaine story or what would you say is inspiring about prefontaine uh like from the philosophy from the technique from his story uh i think there's a few things i mean there's a lot of things which is why he is who he is it's uh one was just his attitude about it where um he wasn't like this picture ask runner uh i mean he was obviously talented but you know you have the perfect story of like he wanted to be good at something you like most american kids tried football was no hard work was gonna get prefontaine starting in varsity for football starts running fell in love with the mile uh his college coach told him no you're not gonna be a miler you're gonna be a 5k guy and he popularized the 5k in the united states or three mile in some cases and uh i mean he the way he would race i think is what really made him interesting for folks where he would he was just like all guts runner where he's like he's like i mean one of his famous quotes was like if you if you beat me you're gonna have to bleed to do it because he's gonna be an all guts race in in a sport where it gets very tactical at times especially at the like national or i shouldn't say national but at the like competition level the championship level where it's like kind of more of a sit and kick approach a lot of times where everyone's kind of waiting for someone to make a move like pre was gonna make a move really early yeah so this idea of leading from the front which i guess is tactically really a bad idea well from a from a running a pr standpoint it's a bad idea in most cases but so a race i guess is not just about the pr so race winning in a lot of cases and that's what he thought was going to put him in the best advantage to win i think it's just the run from the front i mean what what do you because you mentioned this uh the 100 mile you ran you were in second place and then in 90s you were able to get to the first place how hard is it to run when you're in first place you know i think this is really different some people thrive under it where it's like for them i mean like i talked about jim walsh before i think he loves being in the front if he's in the front he loves it that's where he's excited that's where he knows he's he's doing what he's doing where he's pushing his limits and things like that uh pre was probably the same way and i think there's other folks who are much more comfortable kind of saying let's let things settle down here a little bit and then i'll make my move when it's time to make my move or they think of it as and this is a very important i think lesson for for the average ultra runner is just like knowing what you're capable of is going to be an important piece to the puzzle because you can like you you you can try to say i want to run faster than i'm capable of in an early part of a hundred miler but then you're going to pay for it at the end so really unless you're trying to go for the win and that's a tactic that you think is going to produce a win versus trying to run your fastest time you got to run within yourself within your parameters obviously there's a big question about where those parameters are in a lot of cases which makes ultra marathon even more interesting because it's like there's so much unknown about it it's like well maybe you can go faster and we just don't know yet so there's in the face of that uncertainty there's something admirable like it was with prefontaine where you take the risk and run faster than you know you you think you might be able to run in terms of pace that you can hold so push the pace that's possible yeah explore the unknown explore it's like a pioneer spirit right yeah you know the next frontier kind of a thing but i mean prefontaine also there's other angles with him too where he was like in the amateur era where to be an olympian you couldn't be pro so he's turning down i mean the guy was on food stamps and living in a trailer because he wanted to run at the olympics and there was a lot of like politics involved with not being able to take take sponsorship money and things like that which has changed since then but so he was huge in the movement for that to kind of like you know have a situation where now as an athlete you can finish in most cases finish college sign a big contract with you know a sponsor and then also still compete in the olympic games and go to the events that are actually ones that are going to likely catapult your career and most of the olympic distance endurance events so so he just revolutionized the sport and then to add even more flavor to the whole thing i mean he died a very premature death he got a car accident and died before he would have likely probably medaled at the olympics so he and there is a tragedy the fact that he didn't yeah well he was fourth place at the olympics the prior his first go of it and it was kind of one of those things where it's like fourth place at the olympics is the first man looking out of the first woman looking out and for a guy that had as much hype as him i think like a medal was something he really wanted to take home with him there and especially how that race went i mean yeah i don't know it's it's it's tragic the whole thing but that's one of the things that makes olympics amazing is the tragedy of it like one race decides the story of a lifetime which is like yeah that's why it's that's why it's amazing even if a lot of people get hurt because of it tragedy makes the the triumph special right yeah and well it makes i mean it makes life like a movie almost exactly you know if everything's all sunshine and rainbows then it's not as entertaining to watch yeah there's no adversity to overcome you mentioned shoe technology how much has shoe technology advanced through the past few decades how much has it changed running generally but also running like ultra marathon running i would say an ultra running it's had much of a less of an impact because ultra running is still heavily skewed towards the trails so the technology at least from what we know isn't necessarily translating over to these like massive varied terrain certainly not the technical terrain and things like that now on road races flat stuff like the track stuff the roads the run i guess you a runnable trail um where it's like basically crushed limestone more or less uh you definitely get an advantage from it it's uh and essentially what what happened um is in this probably dated back actually before 2015 uh you know nike decided well their their their uh development team uh was ahead of the curve they've developed this new foam they call like a pibak foam uh and they they realized that like when you step down into a shoe the reason like uh racers a lot of times would wear these flats because they're trying to take out any of that lost energy into the foam in the shoe well this foam that nike came out with is so good that it actually returns way more energy than the average foam did to the point where like when they test these things on like force plate treadmills and things like that it's like a depending on the person's gait and some of things like a two to eight percent improvement in performance i mean we've seen records just across the board get broken since this came out all distances basically yeah yeah i i think from at least from the 5k up through the marathon and i mean we've seen some insane improvements in the marathon i think like uh the women's marathon went from what was considered relatively untouchable like 216 to a 214 and i mean like it was like 218 was like just world class like if you could run a 218 marathon as a woman that was like i mean it still is to a degree but then you know now you have someone run a 214 like that's a huge and you attributed a lot of that to the the shoe yeah yeah i think there's probably other things that come in mind too like now that people know there's a performance advantage from a mechanical standpoint it's also a confidence thing where it's like oh now i can probably try going five seconds per mile faster and maybe they could have anyway and they just now they think they can so they are so there's probably a little bit of that that's just adding to it do you think there's a lot of extra innovation that's still possible like what yeah if you could do this kind of big leap uh with a little innovation of foam is there other stuff that you can do or further innovation materials that make up the foam yeah so they can definitely go much more advantage they put a cap on it essentially so there was a there's also a carbon plate element to this too where they put like this carbon plate in there in between the foam so like i believe when when kipchiki broke well when they did that that kind of uh uh the sub two hour project he actually had on a shoe if i'm not mistaken that never got to market because they put down some parameters on it after uh before it that one came to market where it was actually like stacked up to i can't remember how many millimeters it was an insane amount and they had like i think maybe even three layer plates in there and that was a nike shoe he was wearing yeah yeah so what makes it kind of controversial or difficult is nike came out with these prototypes so a prototype for people don't understand shoes like these these companies they'll develop a shoe and it usually takes like somewhere in the neighborhood of like probably 18 months to hit the market so if you're like a sponsored athlete or work for the company you can get your hands on these shoes before they actually come to market so we had an issue i think this wasn't necessarily as big of an issue in the ultra running community but uh in the track and field olympic distance stuff was a big issue because you had nike athletes having these prototype shoes before anyone could get them and then you had athletes were sponsored by these other brands who couldn't wear them even if even when they did come to market so then we had this like chase to catch up where uh other companies are starting to make their own version of it and now we're getting to a point where most companies have a version of that shoe um but we had a huge transition phase that impacted the olympics big time i mean think of here here's a here's an example of it uh there's a there was a an athlete cara goucher um she was not she was a nike athlete wasn't uh when they came out with this shoe and she ran the olympic trial marathon and got fourth place the first person out and uh two of the people had ever had that shoe on and she was maybe a minute or two like i'd have to look to see exactly but it was within the the performance advantage range and so you could argue that she was the first person in modern running to lose an olympic spot due to a technological disadvantage wow and and it's like i mean it's one of those yeah i mean it's one of those things where like um it's it's a transition right so there's gonna be bumpy road and there's gonna be people that get caught in that transition that it's unfortunate for but it's also like uh you know once everything does catch up and every shoe company has a version of this there's still problems i mean these are incredibly expensive shoes it's like a 250 shoe so it's like at what point do you tell like a wealthy family with a high school kid that you know you can get that 250 shoe but then you go and this kid's family can barely afford a pair of shoes for them much less a 250 parachute like where do we draw that line and that sort of stuff um also just here's the other big one like let's i mean two to eight percent is a massive range what if you're on the two percent versus someone's on the eight percent you know chances are if you're you know blowing a record out of the water you're probably closer to that high end percentage versus someone who's maybe getting incremental gains you're probably closer to that lower end so is it fair to have a piece of equipment that has that big of a range when we're talking about less than a percent determining these races when all is held constant those are fascinating like philosophical questions that i think it's nice to solve that for the shoe or to raise those questions for a shoe because the more complicated place where they will be raised is probably like genetics genetic engineering all those kinds of things yeah it'll get a lot more complicated so it's nice when you have like a particular piece of technology that's just like right there it's a shoe we can understand it we can study it right we may be coming on the precipice of like human powered sport performance is no longer being something that we like look at as this like pinnacle of uh like i guess i don't maybe entertainment's the wrong word but like is that a pursuit you know do we end up just going a different direction i mean i think it's like it's so hard for us to think about that right now because it's so part of like the culture and the lifestyle of the average person where like sport is a hobby of theirs as well as a passion to follow and it's like how complicated does it need to get before people lose that interest and and there could be a future where most of the olympics is esports somebody told me that esports is in the olympics i've been meaning to look this up which is you know like what video so video games are in the olympics yeah yeah it could be as like a trial that they're doing um yeah if this is true i'm trying in real time look it up but if this esports joining olympics in 2024 wow so that could be just a that could be a fun side thing but it could be a first step into a complete transformation what sports mean yeah because you can control video games better than you control for genetics and humans well and in reality we've been dealing with this problem in other areas just with the performance enhancing side of things with drugs and all that stuff too and anyway that that conversation's flared back up with track and field too where we are seeing a lot of records get broken a lot of it probably is to shoot technology but you know in 2020 with the covid stuff you have all these out of competition testing protocols that a lot of these top tier olympic athletes are getting uh to try to eliminate like if you just do inter competition testing like there's potential for people to do things that are uh going to give them a performance advantage but not going to show up on that test on the day of or after their race where now you have these like limitations of being able to test so do we have a like a group of athletes now who decide oh i'm not going to get tested in 2020 do the covid restrictions this is the time to dope up and then you know hit some stride and some records and then you taper back off when they get this thing fired back up again and so there may be some of that as well and i mean that's always been an ongoing problem and yeah so the boost you get from performance enhancing drugs could be tying you relative to the stuff we have in the future right yeah so you might be the last generation of like natural unmodified humans that were running and who knows maybe that's already over who knows who's who's modified that that's that's true you might we might be living through that transition to the new nike shoe but broadly defined yeah so you'll be uh in some sense in in the history books as uh humans used to run without any modifications they used to destroy their body and let it recover and then do it again and they used to be impressed with a with an 11 hour an 100 mile time when we could do it in under an hour now yeah yeah so uh but nevertheless it is incredible the four mile the four minute mile was incredibly impressive uh the i really love the 11 hour mark for the 100 miler and the two hour marathon by most people um for the longest time will start to be impossible you know there's still people that think it's impossible with under certain constraints so uh uh eliot kipchoge of kenya as you mentioned ran a one hour 59 minute 40 second marathon but he had like you said the prototype shoes and he had the the the pace setters yeah i don't know how essential that is but it seems quite essential do you think it's possible first of all what do you think about that accomplishment uh and he is one of the greatest if not the greatest marathon runners of all time what do you think about that accomplishment and do you think it's possible to run a two hour marathon without any assistance yeah i mean i think yeah there's no question about it regardless of technology he's world class if not the best um the i think he i think he could go under two or someone equivalent to him could go under two hours with with the shoe technology probably what it'll take is it'll take a fast course a course that has like very few tangents because like you know turning on a course they estimate adds about a percent to the to the distance so you know when we're talking about a marathon you're getting up to like a quarter mile extra running you know that alone could potentially put you down near near too flat based on what you know we're seeing because i mean kip jaggi he's got a was it 201 40 i believe is his actual world record where it's actually like you know certified so i mean he's right on the door knocking knocking on the door there um yeah the prototype he had since then they put in a regulation where you can't stack a shoe for the roads more than 40 millimeters so you can only have so much of that energy returning foam and you can only have i think one carbon plate in there now uh so that puts a little bit of a ceiling on that technological thing uh but but who knows what else will come out that and and and to be honest who comes out with it because the fact that nike came out with this technology is the reason why it's being allowed to be used if that would have been like you know another running company that that came out with it i'm sure the the regulations would have been slapped down on it immediately and they would have probably just thrown it out all together would have been this politics yeah oh yeah well and i mean it's it you can go you can go super like you know negative with that and say like hey like this is like this is terrible or this is like super nefarious when in reality it's like you know you have a company that has you know billions of dollars and is interested enough in the sport that otherwise doesn't generate a ton of revenue to you know pick up a big tab and support like uh you know track and field and things like that but you know with that you know you you want to be the guy who says yeah thanks for the millions and millions of dollars but we're gonna all those years and money you spent on that phone yeah you wasted it we're not gonna let you use it but you know if you're another company who uh you know revolutionizes the sport in potentially a negative way uh you know maybe maybe you say no to them so it gets interesting that's the way that's how it always happens yeah yeah there's really no way around i think phil mephiton i think it's him that he wrote a book about a two hour marathon what are the limits how fast could we run and i think he puts it like an hour and 42 minutes something like that or 40 something minutes it's kind of interesting question uh of what are the limits uh do you think do you think we'll just keep pushing the limits of what humans are capable of in the ultras in the marathon is this just like the way yeah the uh the way of sport i think ultra for sure because that is a vastly growing sport and it's there's there's a lot of potential for much bigger popular much pool bigger pool of like talent to pull from uh that could really push the needle down on some of these performances and things like that uh especially as it becomes more popular if if people start realizing or i shouldn't say realizing but if a scenario happens where like oh i'm one of the best endurance athletes in the world i make more money running ultra marathons than i do running the marathon then you know all of a sudden we see every record get broken in a matter of a couple of years uh but the the for the marathon i mean it's gonna get faster i think but like to what degree is so hard to know it's very hard to know and the one hour and 40 minutes seems like that's pretty fast yes that's very fast i mean for folks for some perspective there the current world record is like in the 440s per mile per mile like just to add a little flavor to that you're basically sprinting yeah i mean go out to a track and run one lap as fast as you can and then reflect on what time you get and realize like the world record for the marathon is that is that lap at just over 70 seconds per lap so a minute and 10 just over that but you're doing it 26.2 miles so so over a hundred times it's mind boggling but watching elliot kipchoge just first of all he was like smiling at the end of it so the there's an extreme efficiency here too so he's not he's able to just find the right way to maximize yeah maximize efficiency it makes it look easy i mean that that's true for basically every olympic athlete when you watch gymnasts they kind of make it look easy yeah but there's like tens if not hundreds of thousands of hours behind that training yeah just to be comfortable enough to even attempt some of the moves they do in gymnastics is mind boggling that one is super awesome because uh how tragic it is like one little slip up yeah four years of work and your route it's all gone not just four years of work for many of them a lifetime a lifetime of work and they're teenagers and they're teenagers and they get dedicated everything to it that's that's what makes the pursuits of humans so fascinating we kind of talked about this a little bit already but is there something that stands out to you as one of the hardest things you've had to overcome in all the either training or the competing that you've done has there been moments that kind of stand out where you're proud of yourself that that you were truly tested and you overcame it i think i'd be more inclined just because it stands out to me much bigger than any one like hard decision or outcome i had from a particular race is just like the trajectory of like you know doing what i'm doing now is so much different from what i would have ever expected uh you know i mean i was a talented enough runner where i could make the state meet by my senior year at a small division three school and you know compete at a division three college and be pretty modest talent comparative to my to my peers at the top level of division three to think that like i'd be doing anything that was revolved around running as as an occupation is is uh i still second guess that that's actually occurring makes me wonder about the whole simulation theory thing it's like who's got my joystick and exactly uh but they got cheat codes yeah exactly yeah because i mean i went to school to be a teacher and i really loved that profession i taught for about five years and then i got to a point where you know some of it's just perfect timing too like the sport gained enough popularity where there's enough money in it where like i could start a coaching business i could get sponsorships and things like that and actually look at it and say financially i can make a go of this or at least risk it but there's such a fine line between like deciding to do that or kind of staying comfortable because uh i mean i was at the perfect teaching spot for me i was at this uh like project based learning school and just outside of madison wisconsin loved it um one of the hardest decisions my life to make was to step away from that to pursue running and more holistically um and i mean i almost didn't i had a co teacher who was uh i was thinking myself i knew that was like a decision i was gonna have to make the next few years but it was such an easy decision to say well wait one more year and he was just like he was a little more of a free spirit than i was certainly at the time he's like dude what are you waiting for just go why are you here like like after i told him that he like every time we'd we'd i'd come into i'd come into school the next day and he'd be like why are you still here but i mean that was there's a tongue in cheek for sure but uh but it's hard to know that you're going to be successful right in that kind of leap given your like you know because it's easier when you're like an ultra performer early on but to have the faith that you can accomplish something in some regards it's a blessing in the sense that like uh you know failing would have been fairly predictable right whereas if like you know i always wonder i mean i think of these like especially the big sports like baseball football and basketball and you get you know guys who guys and girls who are like identified in like early high school as being the next and it's like what kind of pressure is that to think like well if i'm not like literally one of the best players in the nba in 10 years i failed yeah it's just mind boggling to think if i'm not one of the best at one of the most competitive sports on the planet in what is an athletic i think an athletic state of an nba basketball player is probably one of the most athletic human beings on the planet and to know like at in a teenage year that your your your your success bar is being the best one of the best in the league or the best ever and that conversation is floating around everywhere you look and see versus being able to kind of quietly fail and go back to teaching this makes it a little more digestible i think you have a little bit of more freedom to be great right nobody's expecting you to be right uh is there from that is there advice you can give to young people today high schoolers college students taking on trying to figure out their career trying to figure out their life advice on how to succeed in either yeah i think uh you know one thing i was always interested when i was teaching was like you'd have these you'd have students who had like interests they had what they were good at and sometimes those ran in in unison with one another other times they didn't and it was always interesting to me when you'd have a student who's like i'm really into like you know guitar or i'm really into skateboarding or something like that where it's like pretty small like success rate on that avenue versus what you could maybe accomplish by focusing on just something like a little more standard and i think like really like besides the likelihood of it becoming something you can turn into a profession or not you should just ask yourself like is this something that i want to spend my free time doing uh and because if it is then you want to keep that in your life because that's something that's rewarding motivating it might be the catalyst that gets you out of bed in the morning and you know go to another job in order to go do that thing afterwards and i think nowadays we're getting to a point where like the your reach ability from even a really small like unmonetized thing previously is now an option where if like you live in a city where there's only two other people interested in your topic of area so you're not gonna be able to turn into a job now with the internet you have the world at your disposal so that two to three people in every town can turn into thousands tens of thousands hundreds of millions of people and if you really focus your time and energy into that thing then you know who knows where you can go and how much more enjoyable your life can be if you're able to turn your career into a passion of yours so i think like that is something i would tell tell people um focus on that see the thing you're good at and you kind of sparks that flame and uh go with that even if society doesn't really want you to uh like it's non traditional uh and the odds are low of like traditionally defined success just do that thing i've struggled with that it's like it was always clear especially like in school there's stuff i'm actually good at and stuff that the world wants me to do right yeah and i kept doing the world wanted me to be a plumber when i took that test my sophomore year but even like like academically just going to university and uh academia there's certain ways even in in i would say even in the thing you want to do the way you do that thing the world will want you to do in a certain way and even just like finding your way of doing that thing is uh is really powerful like for me the way i do research the way i learn is is different than colleagues of mine and i realized i realized that that i really like to follow things i'm passionate about versus sort of the rigor of studying every like the fundamentals all across the board and building up in castle um on the fundamentals like layer upon layer just there's a bunch of details in the way i pursue the very thing that i currently do that's different than others and it took me quite a long time to accept like you don't need to do it the way everyone else is doing it doesn't not everyone else but the majority of people are telling you to do it because one is beneficial to do it different because then you'll more likely stand out and two like why the hell are you doing it the way it's not working for you yeah yeah you know i saw that all the time when i was teaching i was dual certified i was my my certifications were in history and broadfield social studies so like econ uh psychology history all that stuff and then i also had a certification of special education which was you know people think of special education a lot of times as like oh it's the you know the kid who is not smart enough to do the regular thing when reality it's like i mean there is some you know there's obviously like you know like certain things like down syndrome and stuff like that but like there's also like a huge population of groups of both like gifted and talented on one end of the spectrum where they're incredibly smart and they're like the geniuses but for whatever reason the standard method of learning does not click with them does not work with them and then they just need a slightly different path or maybe a drastically different path and they're gonna just flourish and you have kids that end up falling on the other end where you know maybe it's really difficult for them to be able to read at the speed of other students but if you give them this specific direction they can just thrive in a certain area and just seeing that like the you know like that there's multiple ways to do stuff and there's not necessarily one path to the end is i think such an eye opening thing to learn especially if you learn maybe that's what i should answer the question that you asked me with is you know keep an open mind as to what paths are forward and know that you know maybe just because even if you look to your left you know to the right and all your classmates are successful doing it one way it doesn't necessarily mean that's going to be the way for you Or does this race allow someone to like hand me a bottle at a certain spot? Or do I have to be in specific areas to get that type of stuff? And it what ends up doing is it ends up bringing a lot more variables to the table. And I think it's interesting, because there's always going to be more variables on the day than you are able to account for. So at a certain degree, you have to kind of find yourself in a position where I'm going to make sure I take care of the big ones, or the ones that are like, obviously, I need to be ready for like, my fueling strategy, my hydration strategy, my pacing strategy, what workouts are going to put me in a position to physiologically have this process go as well as possible? How am I going to like, you know, hold myself accountable in aid station transition, so I'm not like having a ton of non moving time versus moving time and things like that. So there's these like, big variables that you're aware of, and you're trying to optimize over the space of variables. Yep. So you get to start to play with that. When you're looking for performance, it's almost like moving from checkers to chess, right? You have like, or maybe even like connect for something like that, where it goes from just kind of like, well, one foot in front of the other, and when I get to the next station, I'll just eat whatever looks good, drink whatever, you know, quenches my thirst, and then move on to the next one to like, well, which one of these food products is actually going to make me move a little faster to the next aid station? Or, you know, which one of these pacing strategies is going to get me to the finish line faster than the other one and that sort of stuff. So it gets more complicated, more interesting, and in my opinion, anyway, also, there's I mean, but there's a breaking point with that too, because, like I said, there's an endless number of variables you could account for. And there's a distance gets longer, that list gets longer too. So you find yourself in this position where, where you have to at some point say, okay, I've accounted for everything I can reasonably account for. Now I need to be in a mental space where when something happens that I wasn't able to account for, I'm able to respond to it with the right decision and keep going and not dwell on it. Because that's another thing. I mean, you're running slow enough when you're doing 100 miles, where if you make a mistake, you can sit there and just fixate on that mistake and say, why did I do that? That cost me 10 minutes, blah, blah, blah, blah. When in reality, what you need to do is that happened. Everyone else out here is gonna have a situation like that at some point. Mine happened now. I need to figure out how I can move forward at the fastest sustainable pace and not think about what happened back there. And that's where I think it gets really interesting. What would you say it takes to set a world record in the 100 miler? First of all, I think you probably have to focus on that specific event. I mean, there's the interesting thing about ultra running where it maybe deviates a bit from just other endurance sports is there's such a wide range. I mean, we talked about a little bit when I talked about the San Diego 100 versus kind of flat runnable stuff. So can you maybe paint a picture of what are there's a huge range of different kinds of ultra marathon events? What are like, the big ones in your mind? So marathon, we know the distance for a marathon. There's 50k, what are different kinds of there's 100 mile that in your mind, like kind of these islands where, where people gather off? Yep. Yeah. So there's a few that really stand out. I would say the three biggest ultra marathons right now, even from a historic, maybe not necessarily a historical standpoint, but in modern day ultra running is going to be the Western States 100. That's the biggest, most competitive 100 miler. It's on the trail side of things in the United States. Then there's ultra trail Mount Blanc, which is probably the most competitive 100 miler on the planet right now. In previous years, it's been debatable as whether Western States or ultra trail Mount Blanc is more competitive. I think in the most recent few years, you're just seeing a lot more like of the bulk of international talent on the trail side of the sport heading over that way. And then you have the road running side of things where the comrades marathon, which is technically 56 miles, but they call it the comrades marathon, is going to generally be the most competitive ultra marathon. The weird thing is the distance thing, right? Cause most people in the think of endurance sports, they're thinking about precise distances, like five kilometers, 10 kilometers and all that stuff. And then, then you get into the ultra running world and it's like, sometimes it's the event. So like the Western course itself is much more important than the distance, right? Yeah. So the Western States 100 is actually 100.2 miles, which isn't that big of a deviation when you think about it, especially when you figure like tangents are going to probably account for more than 0.2 miles on a hundred mile race. But the ultra trail Mount Blanc, you know, that's listed as a hundred mile, but it's actually, I think like 104, 105 miles. So, you know, it's more, there's different cultures too. So the United States is definitely more motivated, I think, to try to get as close to the exact distance. You're going to hear maybe a little more grumbling. If someone says, I signed up for this hundred mile and it turned out to be 103 miles versus like over in Europe, they don't really care too much about the distance. They're more interested in like a specific route or a loop. Is consistency important in terms of the exact length of the, of the route? So like you can compare performances from previous years, or are they a little bit more flexible? Like they redefine the trail from year to year. Yeah. I mean, it's definitely hard to compare. I mean, there's events that take, for example, I would say the best ultra marathoner in the world today on the men's side is Jim Walmsley. The reason I think Jim Walmsley is the best is because he is the most versatile and not only the most versatile, but he's arguably the best at almost everything up to a hundred miles. So there's a race called the Angela's crest hundred miler. They, the trail has drastically changed from when they originally had that event and it's a different time of year. So it's much warmer on that course. And Jim's not the kind of guy who would sit back and say like, I can't chase that record. But I think Angela crest, when he looks at the segments and the pacing for that one, he's like, that one is maybe not even the same event anymore. So you have that, you have some that are a little more controlled and a little more kind of like preserved, I guess you would say, but I think it gets really rare on the trail side. I mean, comrades is going to be very comparable from one year to the next because that's a road race. And that's where you get, you maybe get like the split in the sport from people who really want that kind of like, I want to compare myself to someone who ran this course in 1970 versus like someone who just says, I want to be competitive today. And you know, maybe the weather is going to be 30 degrees different from one year to the next on this course. But if I beat everyone on this day, then I'm the champion of that big name race, like ultra trail Montblanc or Western States, 100. And my legacy will be cemented because I won that big race. And it doesn't matter when or how the course was or what the time even was to some degree. When you were optimizing for trying to set the world record in the hundred miler, were you doing like analysis of maybe like what were the variables you were looking at? Is it more in the realm of the actual race day, the track, what it looks like versus like the variables of the training leading up to the, to the race? I mean, it evolved a bit. Like, I think the, as I learned more about just like, what is required to kind of really do that stuff. So there's some variables you can control for, you know, I try to control for as many as I can. The big one that kind of stands out that you can't necessarily control for is it's pretty rare where you get an event where they're just doing a hundred miles on a track. It's usually like a, like an event of like a series of different events where they might be like some people out there doing 50 K, some people out there doing 24 or something like the event I did at, there was six day folks out there. They're trying to see how far they could get in six days. So you have like this much wider range of pacing just due to like the distance. So, you know, track protocol is always like you pass on the outside. So if you're running one of the faster paces of the day, which when you go on up to six days, you're going to, and you're doing a hundred miles, you're probably going to be running faster than most people out there. Then, you know, you just end up running more because you end up running in lane two around the turns and then sometimes lane three around the turns. So it's down to those little details that have a big impact. Yep. So I had to build that into my pacing strategy. I also have to build into the pacing strategy, like relative nonmoving time. You know, I did a race just recently, it was the US track and field hundred mile road championships. And I did not stop once other than like, I guess I technically stopped like in the aid station for like a few seconds to like grab bottles and get myself wet. Cause it was like 94 degrees that day, but I didn't like stop at all during that race from like what I would say is like a long period of time where we're getting up to like a minute, but that's pretty rare. Even on the track, like when I ran 11 hours and 19 minutes, I think I stopped three times for maybe a total of like, I believe I have to look back for sure, but I think it was like three to four minutes or something like that. So you got to, you got to figure that into your pacing strategy, especially if you're chasing a specific time. Cause you know, if I'm pacing for, you know, at the time the world record was 1128. So if I'm pacing for say 1127, 30 or something like that, and I don't account for that three minutes of stoppage, then I might run the exact pace I had planned on, but then I'm a minute off of the world record. So 1128, we're talking about 11 hours, we're talking about a hundred miles. Can you mention what the world record was? What kind of world record you set? Can you tell your own story here of what you were able to accomplish that world record that I broke actually just recently got rebroke by a guy over in Lithuania, Alex Sorkin, phenomenal race. I mean, he's won the 24 hour world championships. He's won the Spartathlon, which is another big historic ultra marathon rates, 153 miles. So it's getting a little more lengthy than some of the stuff that I've traditionally done. He ran 1114, I believe it was 56 or 57. So his pace was 645 per mile. Mine was 647 and a half in terms of just like the pacing strategy. I mean, it's, it's just really cool because for me, the motivation with chasing the world record was, it was multifaceted. I think there was, as I kind of moved through, cause I mean, it took me almost six years from the day yeah so that could lend you in eating a meat based diet running across the country uh like the the incredible madman that you are zack i'm a huge fan as i told you many times you're an inspiration to many i'll be there checking in every day if you somehow make it out the starting line on september 1st i know i know joe rogan and millions of others will be as well so i'm excited to see all the suffering that you're going to go through i wish you the best of luck and thank you so much for talking today i really really appreciate it well thanks a bunch of likes it's been a an honor to come on your podcast i've been a fan of it for uh 10 years i've been a fan of it for uh for quite some time and um i thought about wearing a white suit but michael malice already took care of that one so it was well and uh i think it'll be really good for the ratings of this conversation if you end up dying during that run so i'll do my best so the everything that could happen will be positive for for the world you're saying i should try to average 100 miles a day 100 miles well i think you're going to push yourself to again it's not a priority but it's trying to beat that record that's probably going to take everything you have and that that that's truly inspiring i wish you the best of luck man thanks a bunch thanks for listening to this conversation with zac bitter and thank you to ladder belcampo noom and better help check them out in the description to support this podcast and now let me leave you with some words steve prefontaine i'm going to work so that's a pure guts race at the end and if it is i'm the only one who can win it thank you for listening and hope to see you next time I decided I wanted to chase that time to the day I actually did it. And through that five to six years, I think I merged from just like my number one goal was to try to break the world record to my number one goal is how fast can I run this thing? And then ultimately what needs to be done for a human to break 11 hours in a hundred miles. Cause I think that's going to be, I think that's going to happen soon. I think it's going to happen in the next few years. What pace would that be? Sub 11 would be, I think like, I think it's like 635 right about per mile. You're moving quick, but not so quick that like you're, you're, you know, void of being able to think about everything as it's happening. So what's the pace in terms of, if you look for each of the one mile segments for the hundred miles, is it pretty steady six, like in order to break 11 hours, would it be pretty steady 635? Does it go up and down? Do you speed up at the very end? Like what's, what's the pacing? If you were to maybe how much variability is there in the pacing for an optimal performance here? Yeah. So if you're talking about someone, let's say that there was someone, well, let's just take me for example, let's say that we could just like, we had this infinite knowledge and we knew for a fact, a perfect performance for me would produce a 10 59, but I'm not going a second faster and I need to do everything right in order to run a 10 59. Uh, I would definitely want to either have a slight negative or slight positive split. So when, um, and I think there's, I think there's a, there's a range in there where like being a little bit faster the first half and the second half isn't going to necessarily change your outcome or being a little bit slower the first half and a little bit faster. The second half isn't going to drastically change your outcome. So that's what you're referring to. The split is you're looking at the first 50 miles and the second 50 miles. And you can break it down as tiny as you want. Like I think, uh, when you take out the outlier laps where I stopped to use the bathroom, which would have been that like three to four minute nonmoving time that I talked about before, my splits were really tight. Um, I had a couple that were, um, it was weird cause that, that track that I did that on was actually like 400 and some weird number, like 400 and like 38 meters or something like that. So I actually like ran like my numbers based on that. So they're there normally I'm dealing with 400 meters and then it's a little more like clean as to like what my lap splits are going to range from one event to the next. So we're talking about running a hundred miles on a track. Yeah. And so that you can be really scientific about getting the, the, this, the, um, the pacing, right. And, uh, you're, you're running on the inside lane or is there some kind of tricks to this? Like, are you alternating directions? Yeah. They'll switch directions at most events every four hours. So you'll do four hours one way and then they usually put a cone out. And once it hits like, like, let's say it hits four hours, you finish the lap you're on and then you do a loop around and then you start the next, your next lap. Would you say you take the exact same number of steps? Like when you're really in the groove, when you take in the pacing, are we talking about that level of precision or is it a little bit more feel? You mean like foot strike frequency? Yeah. Like frequency then over the distance to the lap. Would you say it's so precise that you're like, you get in this groove where it's like, gosh, you're making me wish I would have strapped more like a foot pod to my head. But like, yeah, so I think like my guess is it's pretty precise. Like is there a video of this? Sorry. I keep interrupting. Is there a video of this? Cause I, I've actually, this is now three years ago, build a computer vision algorithm that counts foot strikes. Oh, really? Yeah. For fun. Yeah. I was trying to understand, uh, we'll talk about this later. We have the same definition of fun when I got my, find myself on a track for all day and you find yourself counting foot strikes. I was trying to understand if, if there's how much variability there's in a extreme, like elite performers within a particular race, but also across races. It was just interesting to me from a robotics perspective, if like how much variability there is in the human body and in the way they use legs to move quickly. I think my guess would be that at the individual level, it's going to be pretty precise, assuming the pacing is consistent. So you get, so my pacing on that day, I ran two minutes faster the second 50 miles than I did the first 50 miles. So my splits were very even most of the day. I actually ran some of my fastest miles at the end. Uh, so there's going to be probably a slight variance from my fastest miles to my slowest mile in like your cadence or your foot strike. Uh, but probably not by a huge margin, but you might have a pretty big variance from one person to the next. So you get someone whose gate is just a little bit different. So like for me, I supinate, which means I kind of come down on the outside of my foot and I'm kind of more of a mid forefoot striker. So that's going to kind of impact my cadence to a degree. Whereas you might have someone who is kind of more mid to rear their foot or heel striker and they might pronate where their foot kind of rolls in. Uh, so that person may have a little bit of a different cadence as well. So you get someone, and I think you see this in elite marathoning too, which is going to probably just be a much larger data pool, uh, much, much more probably precise from just like a number of opportunities to study this. And I think even their ranges from one person to the next can be, I wouldn't say drastic, but, you know, to the degree of like 10 to maybe even 20 steps per minute or something like that from one person to the next. But most people, the faster they go, the higher their cadence is going to be. The slower they go, the lower their cadence is going to be, but there's going to be probably a range of optimal lowness and I don't know, probably optimal highness too than that. If you can just linger on the 11 hours, the person, first of all, would you like to be the person that breaks 11 hours? And second of all, the person that does break 11 hours, like what would, what would it take? And third question is, is it even possible in your intuition? Yeah. I mean, I would def I would be lying to you if I said I didn't want to be the first person to break 11 hours and a hundred miles. I think that'll be, um, would be a cool like barrier to be the one to usher that in. But with that said, I think I'm much more motivated in seeing it done from the sense that like, I think when we're talking about records, it's something that is inevitable that it's going to get broken. So, I mean, we were talking about happiness before this, right? So I've contemplated this in the past, um, where I was thinking to myself, like, uh, if my motivation is to break a world record or any record for that matter, course record and have that be my defining reason or my defining motivator, I probably need to do an assessment of what I'm kind of where my mind is at and where my focus is at. Uh, and just reflect on how I'm behaving in life because it's going to get broken, right? I mean, I could run 10 50 tomorrow and in 10 years, chances are that's no longer going to be my world record anymore. Someone's going to run faster than that. So if you're living to hold on to a record versus living to try to move the sport forward, which anytime you break a world record, you're moving the sport forward, then, then you have to look at that as like, that was my contribution. And whether I contribute again or not is kind of besides the point. What you want is that your performance, your contribution brings new people into the sport who are excited, motivated, and they can make their contribution. And then we can ultimately see, well, how fast can someone run a controlled environment, a hundred miler. And that's what I really want to see. Uh, cause I think I've gotten so much enjoyment from the sport. I mean, I've gotten so much enjoyment from the sport. I've been able to turn it into a career. And I think there's, there's other people who can do the same thing and it's not necessarily going to come at the expense of my career. Uh, but it's going to bring more attention to the sport. It's going to bring more interest in the sport. It's going to open the sport up to people who maybe otherwise would have never thought about it, seen it, considered it. And to me, I think that's like a much more rewarding goal than saying I want to break this record and I want to hold it for decades or I want to die with this record. So I never have to see someone go faster than me. Well, that's the progress of human civilization was down on the shoulders of giants and we keep creating cool stuff. Well, and it's, it's the other thing is just like, if you're honest with yourself too, it's, uh, I mean, we're seeing this right now in the running world where, you know, new innovations come in, new technologies come in, new nutritional approaches come in. And then we see like the new crop of folks have advantages that the old crop didn't have. And it can be easy to look back on that and say like, Hey, well, um, you know, if I would have had that product or if I would have done that, I would have run this. But then you're getting into that negative, you know, thought process again, which I generally try to stay off of. It's like the caveman. If I had fire, I would have done right. But with this, look at these idiots up there with their cars. If I would have had a car back then, I would have been ruled the world. Um, let me just zoom up briefly and ask you about kind of beauty and love. What's the most beautiful thing about running to you? Why do you love it? I think, uh, there's kind of a couple of directions to look at it through our lenses, look at it through. There's like the, in the moment, right? There's always going to be that run where, uh, you're clicking along and things just feel great. You get some endorphins and you get the, the, you know, the, the quote unquote runner's high and that sort of stuff. And that's like just like this great feeling that you can kind of tap into on the like the real, like, like in the moment type of level. Uh, you know, you've, my wife and I talk about this because she's a competitive ultra runner as well. And, um, you will, you'll, we'll have a day where, you know, we'll take a forced day off or something like that. And it's necessary, right? It's going to allow the enjoyment to continue. But you get into this like routine of, I wake up in the morning, I do this run and that kind of gets my day started. That gets my energies up. I get that runner's high afterwards. You remove that from the equation for a rest day. And you just start like, oh man, I don't feel like I never got started today. Like, you know, it's just this weird thing. It's almost, I think it's, it's funny because non runners don't always like necessarily recognize it because for them it's the complete opposite. They're like, if I can get away from not having to run today, that's going to be a good day versus. But it's one of those things that I think gets more addictive the more you do it. So, uh, so that's purely from the running perspective. There's this joy of, uh, of the runner's high of the post after the run. You feel like you can take on the world, that kind of thing. Yes. And I think that's one of the drivers from just the quality of life standpoint. Uh, just, uh, you know, and in the moment, immediate gratification, uh, standpoint. But then there's like, I think the bigger picture stuff or the longer term stuff. And for me, that enjoyment is like just the process like of, uh, okay, I'm starting at this fitness level and I'm going to do these workouts and by doing these workouts, I'm going to see incremental progress from them. And then that's another kind of like, kind of short term gratification. That's maybe a little longer than the day to day, but, um, still like shorter than like a career or a, or a buildup for a particular race where you're saying you're seeing yourself like, okay, maybe I'm focusing on short intervals right now. And on week one, I covered this much distance in three minutes, but by week four, I'm covering this much distance and you can just see that progress is almost like, uh, in elementary school when you get the gold star for reading a book, it's like, did that gold star really mean anything? I don't know, but I felt great when they gave it to me. There's something about just finding improvement and people love to see improvement, I think. So that's where, uh, I think you can also get some value in it saying like I started here and I got there. Um, and then I think there's also just like, uh, I would call this maybe more the cherry on top, which is like where you express your work, which is the race itself, where that's going to be kind of the thing that kind of like, uh, shows up on the end result and where it kind of identifies whether you did things right or wrong. Yeah. So there's a sense which, in which training is a kind of, uh, preparation towards race day and race day being the thing where you get to be the artist. You get to create this, this piece of art and they might suck, it might be beautiful. Uh, I mean, I, I, I see in the grappling world, I see competition in that same way when I feel the best about it, which is like, sounds pretentious to say, but like, I'm trying to be the best version of myself in this particular day of competition and to do something that I'll be proud of in, in, uh, in an artist way, not in a kind of some kind of numerical way, but like as a holistic sense, like do something cool. Like in grappling, that means for me, that means like not stalling, like taking big risks and trying to dominate another person in the, in the context of grappling and, and do it, like push myself to the limit, both cardio wise and technique wise, and just play, play beautifully. I mean, you see this in kind of chess, there's systematic chess players and there's people that allow themselves to have those moments of genius where they take the big risk that eventually pays off or doesn't. And that to me is art that, I mean, there's art within running, there's art within chess, there's art within grappling. And you got a chance, like all the training is more like science. And then it feels like the competition days art. Yeah. I think that that that's a really cool, cool way to look at. And I think it's when you really open up the perspective of that too, it's like even, uh, obviously, you know, having a great day, like winning the tournament or, you know, getting further than you were expected to, or beating someone who you've never beaten before or something like that. Uh, or in the running perspective, like achieving that goal time, uh, that sort of stuff. Obviously those are kind of like the ones you, if, when you're honest with yourself, you really want, and you're going to probably get the most satisfaction out of, but even when they don't go wrong, like maybe like with your grappling tournament, uh, analogy, the, you know, maybe the guy you're grappling against does a move on you and you're like, I was not prepared for that move. So now the enjoyment becomes, okay, back to the drawing board. Now I need to find out what do I do when that happens to me next time. And that's where the, I think the why comes in again, same thing with running. Like maybe I make a mistake and, you know, like eat something I didn't really want to eat or, or thought was going to work, but didn't work. And it costs me more time than I gained by having it or something like that. And then I go back to the drawing board and say, okay, well, I can't do that. That didn't work. Or if I'm going to do that, I need to be more prepared to be able to do it. And I love that part of the sport. Um, just the rearranging of things and adjusting and tinkering. There's some sense in which the mistakes and like the flaws give us meaning. Cause like if, if everything, um, if you weren't able to find mistakes and something you've done, it feels like the life would be void of meaning. It's a lost opportunity too. Like if, I mean, like when I look at even my a hundred mile race of 11, 19, I can find spots in there where I was like, Oh, you know what? I could clean that up a little bit. Maybe if I do this differently. And I mean, that's going to get me, you know, a little bit faster. If I sat back and said, Hey, well things went great that day. Cool. Let's see if we can replicate it. Then, you know, I probably run 11, 19 again. So can we talk about training a little bit? What does your training look like year round day to day, hour to hour, like optimal? Maybe, uh, maybe you want to pick a race in the context of what you want to discuss that, but, and also people should follow you on Instagram. You have a lot of kind of interesting, um, like little glances into your training process and into your training thinking, which is quite fascinating. But if you look at an optimal training process, what does that look like? Yeah. So I think, uh, the, if we were looking at it from like a philosophical level or like an approach level, I think there's some things that carry over from regardless of the distance. So I think working on your weaknesses and things that are least specific to what you're going to do on race day, but are still going to be important things in terms of improving your ability to perform on race day or maximizing your potential, uh, with the things that are specific you do first. I say that, but there's a caveat with endurance sport. I think maybe even more specifically with things like our ultra marathons or a hundred miles where you want a really strong aerobic foundation or like a base before you really start, I think, structuring things towards a specific one. So for me, I think like a target for me is oftentimes like, uh, you know, getting really fit at like what my pace would be at like my aerobic threshold or what a lot of people may be called like a maximum aerobic function. Um, I mean, the running world is kind of weird where we have like these terminologies where there's sometimes multiple words that essentially mean the same thing, but one is from like, uh, just an actual physiological reaction and one is just like a feeling and stuff like that. So you mentioned time on feet versus time in optimal physiological state. Like how important is it just to get like running done versus like running in a particular pace that would depend on the event. I would say to a degree and there's contradicting ideas about like kind of how to structure it. I think a lot of times like, uh, you do want to like time on feet in most cases is just going to be like I'm running easy, whatever feels easy that day. And that can be different from one day to the next. Like I might feel great and you know, that produces a much faster pace than if I feel really miserable or something like that. Um, so that's why I think a lot of times running, well they'll, they'll do the whole perceived, perceived effort or perceived exertion. And there you're looking at kind of understanding the response your body has to a certain effort level and you're supposed to target a certain effort level in order to like get a certain response. So to maybe simplify that a little bit or make it a little clearer, like I think I focus on essentially like short intervals. I focus on longer intervals or tempo runs. Uh, I focus on, um, like race pace intensity, which is a lot of times what I'll build my long run around. Um, but I'll also like, those are kind of like the small pieces to the puzzle. Those are the options you're working with. Yeah, but I'm going to always try to work with those options on top of a massive aerobic base, which is going to probably be like 80% of the work. So how do you build that massive aerobic base? What are we talking about? Just distance? Distance and essentially, so I like to call it microstressing because you're going to always start at a different spot depending on where your fitness level is at and depending on where you're at as an individual. I'm going to be targeting my aerobic threshold. I'm going to get right up to it, but not necessarily cross over it. Um, it's, it, you know, it's, it's been popularized as maximum aerobic function as kind of a training philosophy. That philosophy in itself, I think maybe is a little more like holistic where they're saying, do this basically all the time. And by doing so, you're going to, like, you're going to raise your aerobic potential by so much that, you know, you can kind of like race yourself into shape at that point. And this would be maybe more specific for like shorter distance or endurance runs where you're not going to really race yourself in the shape of a hundred milers. But for five Ks, you might, you might do like a huge base building phase where you're going up to that maximum aerobic function or that aerobic threshold and you're watching your pace come down at that. So the rule there is basically like if you're seeing improvement, that's the sign you're looking for, or which would just be your pace dropping at that heart rate or at that\n",

      "Text: The following is a conversation with Mark Normand, a New York comedian who has a way with words that is often both dark and hilarious. Let there be a warning, dear friends, to proceed with caution and to wear protection. You may, in fact, need it. He has a special on his YouTube called Out to Lunch and a new special on Netflix as part of the standup season three series I recommend you watch. This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, here's my conversation with Mark Normand. I asked Tim Dillon about Bukowski first, so let me continue on that tradition and ask you about something that Charles Bukowski said about love. Wait, are we rolling? Yes. Oh, geez. No hello, no nothing. Nope. I thought I was robotic. Bukowski said, love is a fog that burns away with the first daylight of reality. So Mark Normand, let me first ask you about love. What are your thoughts about love? You talk about your relationships quite a bit. Do you think love can last? I do, but I think it's work. Everybody wants love to be this prepackaged, perfect euphoric thing, but you gotta, it's like a good body, you know? We're all born with a good body, but you gotta keep it in shape. And it's the same with a loving relationship. I think you. Nobody wants to do the work, that's the problem. You talked about, I think you told a story about being unfaithful to a previous girlfriend or something like that. I think the story goes that you were like drifting apart. Who were you talking to? Burt Kreischer maybe or something like that? Oh yeah, we were high school sweethearts, dated for like 12 years and then. So that wasn't love anymore. That was more like relationship, that was like. It was comfort, it was routine. And we just slipped into that married life autopilot world. And I tried to break up, I think, and it didn't take. It was one of those things. Our lives are just so baked in. And then I think I cheated and she caught me and it was ugly. And then we went to therapy to try to work it out, but it's much like a car that gets into a wreck. The door just never closed the same. You know what I mean? Yeah, so what are your thoughts about then commitment like outside of love marriage? I think it's an antiquated idea. I think it's kind of silly and unrealistic. And I think we're coming out of that as we get all polyamorous and non binary and queefy and all this stuff. I think we're slowly moving away from that. But I think a lot of the ladies, more majority women like marriage, like the idea of it. Like I'm a fiance now or whatever you call it. I'm engaged. And I mean, she is just woo wee going hog wild. She's loving it. She's got the dress thing, pick a venue flower and she's deep in whereas I feel guilty because I'm just like, ah, geez. Is it planned already? When's the wedding? You see Squid Game, I'm just living life. Yeah, it's planned. It's in New Orleans. I'm from there and it's next year. Are you married? No, single. Virgin? Of course, yeah. I can't imagine. I bet you'd be great in bed. You're ripped. Best hairline in podcasting. Yeah, I don't know. I haven't tried yet. So we'll have to see. All right, well, let me know. Pretty big hog on you? Yeah, I could see you packing a crazy, crazy tool downtown. That matters to girls? Apparently, yeah, that's all I hear about. Okay, New Orleans. You grew up in New Orleans? Yeah, born and raised. Treme outside the French Quarter. Have you ever been? Yeah, don't remember it. Oh, you drink? Yeah, I drink. Of course I drink. I don't know, I can't tell if you have fun. No, not really. But in Russia, of course I drink vodka, all that kind of stuff. Oh, right, in Russia. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes. Gotta know. Vodka. Beer was just labeled an alcoholic beverage in 2011. Fun fact. What do you mean? In Russia. It was just drinks. It was just like apple juice before. It finally got declared legally as an alcoholic beverage. Which means you can regulate it, that kind of thing. I guess so. Yeah. See, that's where your brain goes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I just go, oh, these fucking Ruskies are. I didn't even know there was rules about drinking. This is good, I'm learning about Russia from you. So what's the difficult memory, experience from childhood in New Orleans that made you the man you are today? I don't know if it made me the man, but jeez, I had a lot of scuffles in the neighborhood. I was the white kid in the neighborhood. So I was automatically the odd man out, the minority, the weirdo, the dork, the dweeb, the honky. So just a lot of memories of like getting slapped in the face by guys and just having to take it because there's like five guys there. And they'd be like, oh, look, you didn't even fight back. And you're like, what am I going to do? Hit you and then get beat up by these guys? So a lot of that stuff was a big bummer growing up. Got robbed all the time, lost a lot of bicycles, had a bicycle taken from under me, that was pretty brutal. These kids pulled up, you know, they're like 17 and I was 13 and I had a face paint on. Like I had a, not black face, but I was at a summer camp and I had a rainbow face painted on me. We were helping kids that day. So I let them put paint on me. And so now I'm riding home. What a mark, what a goober I am. I'm riding home and these guys see me a mile away. I'm a sitting duck and they go, we can take his bike. He's got a fucking rainbow on his cheek. So they just go, hey, you know, like cut in front of you. They go, let me try your bike. I go, I'm good, I'm good. I knew what they wanted. And they go, let me try the bike. And then they just pushed me and took the bike. So stuff like that was really shaping the insecurity, the self worth. Did it, cause I've been mugged when I was younger too. Really? Yeah, it changes your view of human nature a little bit. For sure. You go, wow, I didn't know people could be this mean. This cool. Yeah. Inconsiderate. I'm always worried about it. Did I fart too much? Am I annoying? Am I pissing this guy off? But what a way to live. Just, I want the bike, I'm taking it. Fuck his feelings. For me, that quickly turned into realizing that that's just a temporary phase that those folks are in. Like they have a capacity to be good. Sure. For some reason, for me, that was a motivation to see, can we discover, can we incentivize them to find like a better path in life? Like I wasn't like all like, I don't know, Gandhi about it. Of course I was pissed and all those kinds of things, but I don't know, it seemed like just the kind of thing you might do when you're younger. You hope. But this is adult crime, obviously. Yeah, I know, but yeah, exactly. And then it solidifies and then you're beyond saving at some point, but it's like, there's always, there's always an opportunity to make a better life for yourself, to become a better version of yourself. Yeah, and I remember coming home crying with no bike and my mom, my parents are like liberal to a fault. You know, where they were like, oh, well they need it. They're poor kids in the neighborhood. And you're like, all right, but I also like have a bicycle that I ride around, you know, and I also like to live in an area that's not just, you know, riddled with theft and vandalism, but they were just like, oh, they need it. And then it was a moot point, we just moved on. So I remember very young being like, all right, I gotta figure my shit out. Okay, so you said you were beat up quite a bit, like bullying and stuff. Pushed around, I was never hospitalized or anything, but you know, you get a black guy here and there and a bloody nose, stuff like that. And it was just the outnumbered thing. The violence didn't really bother me because you're just kids, you're boys. But it was the predatory, let's get him. You know, we can take him down. He's, you know, he's an easy target. That's what kills you, the mental part. Yeah, you know, until you actually said I didn't realize, I've been in, what do you call them, scuffles. And there was just one that stands out to me where, yeah. Let's hear it, Faddy, bring it on. And you do jujitsu and all that stuff, right? Yeah, I can see the guns through the suit, you're like John Wick. All right, well, I used to have, now you're gonna start making fun of me, I used to have long hair for like a couple of years. I was in a band playing music and stuff like that. And there was, like most of the fights I've been in were basically one on one, maybe a little bit like, a little extra stuff, but not outnumbered. And this one particular time, I've learned a lot of lessons, but one of them was, there was a fight started between me and this other person. And then his buddies, I guess, were there. And they, as opposed to like breaking it up or letting it happen, one of them grabbed my hair. It's the first time anybody grabbed, like used my hair in a fight, which I haven't since then realized that that's actually a really powerful grip and a powerful weapon. Oh, very vulnerable of you. And then my head got pulled back and they pulled me down to the ground. Like I couldn't do anything, it was so, I remember being exceptionally frustrated. Yes. That was the feeling like, I can't do anything here. I'm like trapped. And then they were just like kicking me and hitting me and stuff like that. And the outnumbered part of it, because I always kind of remember the trapped part because I just hated from a fighting grappling perspective, how like, the feeling was this isn't fair. Yes, that's what it is. It's a deep, deep unfairness that you just can't win. The mob wins. Yeah, the mob wins. Scary stuff. But it makes a man out of you in a weird way that builds character, you realize life isn't fair early and you go on from there. So there's something there. And look at you today. They're probably eating out of a dumpster at a Krispy Kreme and you're here, got eight podcasts, you're doing great, talking to giant titans of the industry. No, I do remember returning home that night. I mean that you said you were crying. That's really formative. Like that's the point in which you get to decide what do I make of this moment? I mean, especially when you're younger, maybe it's not presented to you that way, but like some of the greatest people in history were bullied in these kinds of ways. And they made something of themselves in this moment, like bullied by life in some kind of way. It's like an opportunity for growth. It's weird, but like hardship even in small doses is like an opportunity for growth. Totally, I mean, look at Richard Pryor. They say he's labeled as the best comedian of all time. Grew up in a whorehouse, watch his mom get plowed by these guys in the middle of Indiana, I wanna say. And just who had a harder life? He would suck dick for drugs, all this stuff growing up, beat up. And then the weird thing is, oops, sorry, that's my birth control alarm. And then the whole world is like trying to get rid of bullying, but we still do bullying, but now it's accepted bullying. It's very strange. So you're a proponent of beating kids up, is that what you're saying? Yes, and sex with them. All right. But no, I just think it's part of life and it's horrible, it's like rain, you gotta have it. Look, a rainy day is a bummer, but you need it. And I think it's similar to that. What was your relationship like with your mom, your dad? What are some memorable moments with them? What did you learn from them? Good parents, they're giving, thoughtful. A little out to lunch, they were workaholics, so it was hard to get a lot out of them. And my dad was kind of an angry dad. I think he just had like a weird childhood and he's just trying to make it and he's trying to provide, but it's hard. And we live in this horrible neighborhood and we're getting robbed all the time. So life was kind of coming down on him all the time. So then he'll take it out on you or whoever, he would snap. But great parents, they cared, they put us first, but there wasn't a lot of, you ever go to a friend's house as a kid and there's like a picture of a ski trip and you're like, ski trip? What the hell is that about? It wasn't a lot of that and smart, very smart people, but I don't know how well they were at socializing. So you never like bonded with them like on a deep human level? Some bonding, but rarely deep. Yeah, it was just almost coworker. Hey, cold out, huh? What? It's cold out, huh? Oh yeah, like that kind of stuff. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, I got you. Get there a little bit, but my parents are done. I hope they never saw this, but they would do a thing where my dad especially would do a thing where he would, he knew how to cut you down right to the bone and so after a while you're like, I'm not even gonna interact with this guy because he can get you so well. One time we were at like a Thanksgiving, some kind of family event and all the cousins are there and I remember I was holding court. I was a young boy finding my comedic legs in this weird tumultuous sea we call a family and I was killing and my dad comes out and he goes, what are you holding court? And I was like, ah, and I felt like I was this big. I just whoo, shrunk down. He just nailed it because in my head I'm like, I'm holding court, look at me, I got the whole room and he goes, what are you, what are you holding court here? And I'm like, who the hell do you think you are? And I was like, he's right, I shouldn't be holding court, who the fuck am I, I'm nobody. So stuff like that. Was he aware of that you think? He wasn't, he wasn't, I don't think he was, but. Do you give parents a pass when they're unaware of the destructive, like is it better when they're unaware? Because it seems like that's the way. That's true. That's the way parents often fail is they're not intentionally malevolent, they're just like clueless. Yeah, it's a bittersweet thing because you're like, well, okay, he's not malicious, he's not trying to hurt me, but also he doesn't know he hurt me. I don't know, it's tough because if he was trying to hurt you, I guess that would be worse. So you're the fully baked Mark Norman cake at this point Yeah, it's a shitty cake. Fruit salad. You know, the sense of self worth you mentioned. I think in your comedy, there's a sense like you hate yourself. You think? I didn't know if that came through. Shit, I was trying to hide that part. God damn it. I mean, when you like in the privacy of your own mind, are you able to love yourself or is it mostly self hate? Jeez, what happened to this podcast? I didn't know I was on Dr. Phil. Dr. Phil. I thought we were gonna talk about engineering and climate change and rockets. We'll get there. Okay. Starts with love, goes to rockets. All right, I like that. I like that's a t shirt. I mean, like. What's the question? Sorry. Do I feel love? No, no, like. Do I love myself? Yeah, yeah, so are you like this engine of being self critical of just being constantly anxious about how the world perceives you, these kinds of things? Is this something that you just go to for comedy or is this who you are as a human being? I think I don't wanna explore it. I think I get around it. You know, I tap dance around it, but I get it out a little with my act maybe, because I can't do it. I'm not doing it in real life. So I'll get out this no love, not loving myself. I don't know who wants to love themself. Everybody always like you gotta love yourself. And then when you meet somebody who does love yourself, you're like, I fucking hate this guy. Don't you hate the guy who's upset? I'm great, I'm awesome. Life is good. You're like, ah, this guy sucks. I'd rather an insecure guy. So maybe I wanna stay insecure. Maybe I don't wanna find this love for myself. Well, okay. So self love, like just appreciating who you are, or like appreciating the moment of being grateful doesn't have to express itself by the guy saying I'm awesome. True. It's more just like humility. It's just like walking calmly through the world and just being grateful to be alive, that kind of thing. That's good. And like, oh, being appreciative of all the accomplishments you've made so far. I say all this because mostly I'm extremely self critical in everything I do. And so, and I kind of enjoy it. I think it's a nice little engine that it makes it fun. It makes life fun, because it's like if you hate everything you do, like you've done in the past, that gives you like, all right, we can do better. Yes, but that's the key is making yourself critical. Always trying to get better. I could change this, I could tweak this, I could improve this. When you just go, I hate that I do this, I suck, you just shut down. So that's the key is always being productive with the criticism. Yeah, and the basics of life, I'm just like grateful for it, to be alive. That's nice to be coupled that with self criticism. Two legs, again, the hairline, the hog, the muscles, the world. You got a good brain on you. I mean, you're lucky. You're in the top, most people are fat as shit at Burger King right now, hitting their kids. Yeah. You're in a Ramada hotel, sitting with a low level comedian. For the record, I ate McDonald's last night. Oh, all right, well, you're human. Well, just so you know, this is not me defending, I'm not sponsored by McDonald's, but I mostly eat meat, and there's nothing wrong with the beef they have. It's actually one of the easiest ways late at night. I think it's worse. I don't know if it's actually cow. It's actually rats. Yeah, you're right. But hey, it's just meat. I'm a meat guy myself. They say in 20 years, we're gonna look back and go, can you believe people ate meat? It's gonna look like somebody like slavery. Yeah, there's some ethical, difficult things with factory farming. Yeah, so let's ride it out now while we still got it. And now it's on record. Tom Waits says something about New York. You like Tom Waits? I think he's underrated. I think he's got great, he's got a great, he's great at quips and quotes. Check him out on YouTube. He's got some montages and super cuts of him being hilarious. What does he say about, I'd rather have a bottle in front of me than a frontal lobotomy. That was the one. That was the one that sold me. I was like, this guy's awesome. Yeah, but his music, cause he's just a genius musician. Yeah. Anyway, he was talking about New York. I was walking around, I'm in New York right now. We're in New York right now. It's still a magical city to me. A lot of people are quite cynical about it, about the state of things, but. Go again. Not like Michael Malice, like a lot of friends of mine, they're just a lot of folks in San Francisco and New York, there's something about the pandemic where people have become quite cynical about the place they are and they try to escape. It's interesting. I mean, they're asking some difficult questions about what they are in life. They're having like a self imposed midlife crisis. It's good, I think, for everybody to go through this process. But I think, I hope New York reemerges. It will. As the flourishing place for the weirdos. Anyway, Tom Waits said, New York, of course, is to be in endless surreal situations where a $50,000 gun metal Mercedes pulls up in a puddle of blood and out steps a 25 carat blonde with a $2 wristwatch. Woo! And he goes, he keeps going on. So like, it's like a. That's like bars, he's like a rapper. And then Ben Franklin's like, you know, you don't really need the word hat. You can just put a picture of a hat. And he made a new sign, which is a picture of a hat and it like helped the business or something. That's like some old wives tale or whatever. But I think about that all the time when I'm writing. I thought this was going to like, there was no sign. It went like super like nihilistic. Oh, maybe, maybe, that could work too. What, like as a comedian, so I'm a fan of yours. I enjoy, I really enjoy you in conversations. Wow. Now I'm getting nothing out of it. This is like emotion. You're tough not to read. Cold inside. I mean, just the quickness you have, obviously you're also a great stand up comedian. What's your favorite medium to shine in? So you have a podcast yourself, an excellent podcast. You're often a podcast guest. Yeah. Which is always fun to listen to, how you're going to deal with the different people. You're great on Rogan. Oh, thanks. What do you enjoy most? Podcasts are great because you can stretch out a little more. You can breathe a little. You know, with a stand up set, I like to be like boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. But podcasts are great because it's conversational. So you can be, it's almost like you're being funny with your friends. Whereas a stage is like a, this is a piece. This is a presentation. But I think the podcast is great, but you don't get the reaction. Unless the host is laughing, you can't hear the guy in his car in New Jersey driving to work going, ah! Every now and then I'll read a comment like, I spit out my coffee when you said this. And I'm like, but it's not immediate. You want the immediate. So stand up will always be number one, but there's no better feeling than killing in a room of people who don't know who you are. Strangers, you're in the middle of nowhere. You left your wife at home. You left your kids. You left your house. You're in the middle of bumfucked Dickville and murdering for these hillbilly nobody, whatever it is. And they're slinging their beers and cheering you on. And they carry out and you fuck some fat lady and you leave and you get back to your hotel and you go, holy shit, what was that? No one will ever know about it. Just lost in the ether. That's the best feeling. Yeah. Killing an obscurity as Bill Burr would say. Yeah, this is one of the things that sucks about giving lectures. Like at universities or giving lectures in general is when you look at the audience, you know, several hundred students, they all have a bored look on their face. Yeah, of course. Like my face now probably looks bored, but I'm actually excited to be talking to you. But there's something about just, there's something about a comedy called, maybe this is the contingent of laughter, but like it gives people the freedom to just laugh, to like, to remove that facade of like, you don't have to pretend like you don't care. Like if you care, you can show it and you can have fun with it a lot. Probably liquor helps out too. Yeah, it helps for sure. But there is a, especially, and that's why comedy I think is so popular right now because HR is up our ass. We're scared of old tweets that might come back to haunt us. What did I say on that interview? Even people at offices are like, I put something on Facebook in 1999 that was about fat tits that I liked. Should I get rid of that? Even people say like, there's no cancel, whatever. There is something in the air right now that wasn't there before. It's the video, I'm a Karen, I got caught at Trader Joe, whatever it is. People rat on each other now, everybody's tattletaling because they want the clicks. It's a horrible society we've crafted. But standup comedy gets you to come out, and now people do it at standup shows too. Sadly, but it gets you to come out and let that inhibition down. Because we're all human, we've all had the fucked up thoughts like, man, that guy's fat as shit. It doesn't mean you hate the guy, it doesn't mean you hate fat people, it doesn't mean you're fat shaming. But you can't say that at the office. You can't go, Bob, you're fat as shit. You'll get fired for body shaming. But at the club, you go, that guy's fat as shit. The crowd goes, he is fat as shit. And it's this weird cathartic thing because all we do is tamp shit down. It's kind of like you ever meet a girl who's like all prim and proper in the bedroom. She's like, put a lamp up my ass. Ah, you know, whatever it is. It's because we gotta get it out. We're all repressed in some way. So I guess what you're saying is comedy's important. Yes, callback. All right. Well played, sir. Yeah. What do you think about Austin? What do you think about the comedy scene in Austin? We talk about LA and New York. What do you think about what Joe's trying to create there? So I should say that the reason I moved to Austin, I have this dream of, it wouldn't be funny if I said this dream of becoming a comedian. Oh, yeah. It's an audience, at least. Yeah, that's true. You know, I always said you can hear the music in the distance. I have this dream around robotics and artificial intelligence, whether it's a company, whether it's something else that I was just pulling me to. I actually wanted to move to San Francisco, and then all my friends in San Francisco said, no, it's the wrong place. Yeah. At this time, the cynicism there is just not conducive to taking big leaps into the unknown, excited about the future kind of thing. And Austin was that, for me in particular with Elon Musk, but also just the energy that everybody had, including Joe, the excitement about the future. I don't care if Austin burns to the ground and it actually is a complete failure. Being excited about the future seems to be, like optimism about the future, seems to be the thing that actually makes that future happen, makes a great future happen. So it's always cool for me to see Joe super excited about creating a culture in Austin, like making it a comedy hub. I don't want to overstate it, but I think he really believes it'll be a very big place for comedy in the United States and generally in the world. And so just even believing that, that's powerful. I agree. You start to make it happen, that energy is there. Anyway, so, but that's for me from just an outsider watching the fun of it. I should also mention for less of an outsider, more insider in the martial arts world, partially probably because of Joe, I'm not sure, like John Donahar, Gordon Ryan, the B Team, all of those folks, those are, that might be gibberish to you, but those are like some of the greatest grapplers in martial artists of all time. So it's also becoming this hub of martial arts. So the whole thing is just beautiful. Anyway, what are your thoughts about that scene? Well, there's a lot here, a lot of things to mention. One, I think Joe did do that to a degree, like all these people, Segura lives there now, a lot of comics live there. He's opening clubs, other clubs are opening. I think it's happening. That's the other thing is people go, everybody's moving to Austin, Austin's the new hub. And then they look at their watch and they go, five minutes went by, nothing changed. It's gonna take years, but everybody wants it now, now, now. What, Austin, there's no industry there. There's no Netflix, whatever. And you're like, yeah, I know, but it needs a minute. You can't just do this overnight. So people forget that. So it could happen huge, just give it some time. I mean, he's opening a club, I went and saw it. It's incredible, like it's so perfect for comedy. It's every detail, it's incredible. But so it could happen still. I do think there's a little biting off more than they can chew with Austin because it's not that big. So like. And it's spread out. I mean, yeah, it's not big. And the infrastructure is not quite there to support it. But it has a lot of, comparing from the tech side, it has a lot of land to expand into. So it might become this. That helps. Like you're basically establishing, it's kind of like when you're in New York, you're establishing these whole neighborhoods. And you have the freedom to do that because there's a lot of space on all sides. Yes, okay, so that helps. So again, maybe some time. I do agree with that new hope that's kind of built into human beings of like, let's go to America, let's go to the utopia. We even have it with space. Let's go to Mars. We gotta see what's over there. And it's just red, dusty bullshit, but you still gotta go. So I'm with you on that about this new hope, this new land. And I think that is beautiful. And I think there's a lot of haters. I think there's a lot of naysayers who hate change, who hate anything new. And then I think you gotta go, hey, that hurts, that sucks, but blow me dickless. I'm trying something. You're a loser. Stop hating on me. I mean, how many people hate Elon Musk? Yeah, it's hilarious. I mean, there's some of the criticism on Austin. It's like a fad. Like a lot of people are really, people are excited about Austin and somehow that's like, it's like when Green Day became famous, you no longer want to be a fan of Green Day. But to me, like that's... Well, Austin was already a cool town. Like every comic five years ago, it's like, oh, I got Austin this weekend, I can't wait. So it already had a buzz, but some people think maybe the buzz was the cool part. The fact that it was like this off the beaten path city and now I get to visit it and then leave. But I think it could still be this comedy tech booming place. It just will take some time and people want it right now. Well, on the tech side, it's... It's already there? It's getting there very fast. So, I mean, Elon's really pushing that with the factory. It's just a huge number of people are moving there with jobs. Like you're already starting. And then the opportunities to launch new companies is just incredible. I guess it's not right now. It's like within months, within a year, that kind of thing. But like, it's an opportunity to just start to build shit in a new place. And it's cool. It's kind of like going to Mars. It's like you get to start over. Yeah, and I like the hope aspect. I think that's huge for people. And I'm all for it. I hope it works out. I don't know if it will, but I don't know anything about economies and city planning and all that shit. So it might be too early to say, but I hope it works. Are you still talking about Austin or Mars? Austin. Mars is, eh, there's nothing there. There's no vagina there. There's no food there. There's no water there. I don't know. It seems, I get space travel. I think it's important. But I don't know Mars is really gonna move the needle. So what are your thoughts about Elon Musk and SpaceX and launching rockets into space? I think it's all good because you could say, hey, we could just feed everybody. And I was like, yeah, that's true. By the way, these guys give a ton of money to philanthropy shit that nobody cares about. By the way, it's weird. He could feed Nigeria with pocket change of his. And you're like, well, maybe he has. I heard Bill Gates gave back so much money he saved 6 million lives. But that's a reverse Holocaust, by the way. That's pretty good. What have you done? You're a barista. So I just think space travel is good because you learn about the place you're living in from going to space. It kind of helps you learn about this more. You could say, what's the point of going to this other there? But it does help, I think. Yeah, doing difficult things in the engineering space seems to be a way to develop as almost like an accident, as a side effect of doing a really difficult thing in a team of brilliant people. You develop things like the internet. And you could argue that the internet maybe is not so good for society. No, I'm just kidding. It's good and bad. Yeah. But it's like a pull up. You're trying to get your bicep going, but hey, before you know it, you got decent forearms. But you weren't working on the forearms, you wanted to buy, but you got the fore. And I think that's kind of what space travel is. I like how this pivoted into a workout routine advice. I'm trying to get an analogy going here. All right, they work pretty well. I'll take it. All right. What are your thoughts about, since I'm a robotics person, I'd be curious to see, do you think about the space at all? About, first of all, autonomous vehicles with Tesla Autopilot and Waymo self driving car. I'm not sure if you're familiar with all the autonomous vehicles and so on. So those are robots on wheels. And then there's also legged robots. So next time you're in Austin, you get to meet some of the legged robots. That's what I've been working on. And I find those kind of a fascinating way to explore the nature of intelligence in our computers, but also explore our own intelligence and also explore our own, like what makes us connect to other living beings, whether it's dogs, cats, or other humans. Like there's some magic there that's beyond just intelligence. And I, like when I have the robot dog, there's some aspect to it that, I don't know, brings me joy in a way that a dog does, in a way that a good friend does. Yeah, that's interesting. And I'm not sure if that's some kind of anthropomorphism, like where I'm projecting my hopes for this, what this thing is, but it's kind of built in. I mean, it's just a source of joy. Maybe it's connected to the fact that there's just like a loneliness within all of us, within me. And it's just nice to have other things in your life that move, that recognize you, that kind of thing. I mean, I suppose it's nice to even just have a plant. Yeah, it is. Plant goes a long way. You see a guy with plants in his apartment, it changes the apartment because they're alive. You gotta water them. You gotta put sun on them. So yeah, I think there's something there. And I think you can see people's reactions when you show them advanced technology, like these dog robots or these robots that dance and shit. People are like, what the fuck? Like it hits home in some way, whether it's fear or you wanna fuck them clearly, whatever it is, but it does connect with you in some way. So I'm with you. And I think this is why I don't think robots will take over. You always hear that robot, they're making them too advanced. They're gonna wipe us out, blah, blah, blah. If robots get at human emotions, that is scary because they could get mad at us and kill us and they're stronger and they don't need sleep. They don't need food. They don't need water. They don't get jealous. But if they have emotions, then I think we can dominate them because who knows emotions better than us? We've got thousands of years of evolutionary emotional bullshit. We can go, hey robot, I heard your wife fucked that black and Decker, huh? They're gonna crumble. We can bully them. Emotionally manipulate robots. Yes, that's when we'll win. Right now, they could kill us. They could just, we'd all die. Then we shoot them back, bing, bing, bing, bing. That's no good. But if they do get emotions, then we can go, hey, you look like hell. What is that, a rusty bolt? Hey, you're dropping some oil there, you loser. I think we can win if they do get emotions. This goes back to your father being able to undercut you with a single word. You're right. Yeah, so we're the creators of the robots and then the robots will just, you would say the exact thing where the robot would be like, that son of a bitch. And then it goes back to his hole and just sits there miserable. Right, yeah, hardware looks more like software to me. You can't get it up, yada, yada, yada. But I'm not worried about robots and I think self, what do you think about the self driving cars? Is that just wiping out the horse and buggy? Isn't that just progression of technology? Yeah, so I don't know if you've driven in a Tesla, for example. I have, I rode in the passenger, I just drive it. Yeah, there's several stages in that. I think it's the problem is way harder than people realize. And for quite a while, it'll just make driving more pleasant. It'll make it less stressful. It'll take over some of the boring bits for you and make it easier. Like there's something that happens actually when the car is driving for you in the following way. Like it's staying in the lane, it's keeping distance to the car in front of you. Maybe it's changing lanes. It allows you to relax a little bit. Like you become, you still have to be alert, but you become like a passenger and you get to like take in the world. I mean, somehow that's more relaxing without making you necessarily like bored more. It's energizing more. So I just think it makes the driving experience more pleasant. But when you actually fully automate cars, when you can just completely tune out and start reading a book or go to sleep, that might change society like in ways we don't even understand. Because you'll have, I mean the, it'll probably change the nature of roads because the cars, because now you can be super productive. And so no longer quite matters to you as much how long it takes to get from point A to point B because you're not wasting that time. You just continue working. It's like public transit that comes to you. And so there will be maybe less roads and bigger roads and it will just change the nature of how we get from point A to point B. I think you're right. But then couple that also with the fact that we seem to be more and more comfortable existing in the digital world. Yeah. So like maybe we won't want to go outside more and more. We will just interact with each other virtually. And I don't mean Zoom meetings. I mean, just in other ways that's more fulfilling than a Zoom meeting, but then maybe not because like there's something deeply uncompelling about Zoom meetings. Like podcasts that are remote, unless they're super information dense, at least to me as a podcast fan, kind of suck. They suck. There's no connection. It goes back to the dog thing. With the Zoom, there's no connection. Yeah. And we're not, you know, I don't understand why we're not even making eye contact. I know. But it's something there. It's in the room. There's pheromones. And that's like out of our understanding probably. It's just some kind of weird biological, you know, you ever have Cheerios in a bowl? The Cheerios tend to, they tend to go together. You see a cluster of Cheerios. They're never really hanging out on the other side. And that's kind of how people are in real life. I wonder what the physics of that is. So they come together and they stick. There's so many with molecules. I don't know, I can't remember what it was, but it was fascinating. And I think that's how people are. And I think you try to write a TV show or craft a movie with your team, Zoom, nothing there. Nothing there. It's like phone sex versus penetration. One day you'll learn that. I know nothing of either of the, I look forward, because I think there's a phone sex Netflix documentary that there's a show or something like that that is really popular that I want to go watch. So at least I can learn about that. Okay. I could send you some links. Like really. Oh, on the internet? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. But yeah, self driving car. I think it's just inevitable. It's coming and these truckers are going to have to figure something out. Yeah. I mean, that's an under understood industry actually, because there's not, there's a lot of trucking jobs and people don't want to, well, people don't want to actually take them anymore because it's such a difficult job. So it won't have, or a lot of people believe it won't have as big of a negative impact as folks anticipate. There'll be other automation. I think they'll have a huge impact. Yeah, for sure. I mean, you already see it in McDonald's. You go to the beep, beep, beep. Why do you want to get yelled at by the heavyset woman of color, you know, for making a bad order when you can just, you know, hit the screen? But those interactions I think are human. I mean, that's part of life. So it is scary taking away everything. How long till we're not fucking? That's coming too. Yeah. Then there's going to have two types of people. Are you a fuck in real life? Are you a digital fuck person? Oh, I'm a digital. Oh, I like real fucking. Sorry, we can't date. That's coming. Well, there's also the reproduction side of sex, which is like with genetic engineering, you'll be able to specify a little bit of details. I talked to Jamie Mertzel about that. Like where you can specify like, it'll start with like, I want my child not to have like a high likelihood of diabetes or something like that. And then you just get to specify like intelligence. You just get to specify those kinds of parameters until you're like basically trying to create a perfect human and you lose some of the magic of the flaws that make us who we are. Yes. And you know, I'm pretty sure in the full lineup of humans, like, so let me give you some information. Lay it off me, buddy. Break it down. I'm sure you researched this thoroughly, but a male of the human species, the homo sapien produces 500 billion sperm cells in a lifetime. So that's all, some more than others. That's all uniquely, genetically unique humans that you could produce. So even across those 500 billion, you can select. And so. What do you mean, like abort some or? No, you can choose which of them you want. I mean, just imagine all the genetic possibilities that are there, like all of the possible, like you won the race. Yes. Shocking. Yeah, this is the winner. Which one out of all the 500 billion? You have to imagine what the competition was. Oh, just tarts all day long. Handicap. Well, so it's not actually the fastest sperm or like it's, I think a lot of it is timing and luck. Ah. That's what it seems like. There's actual papers on this and I've actually been reading them. I hope so. So it's not just like the fastest sperm to the egg. Okay. There's a timing thing. So you were just lucky. All right. I believe that. So it's interesting to think about like, once you're able to specify some parameters of what your child is like, how that changes the nature of even just like the intimacy of two humans getting together and making, creating together a child. Yeah. I mean, it changes it. It's almost like, I don't know, it becomes like a factory line of some kind. If you don't meet naturally. Yeah, if you don't meet naturally and then you don't and you get to optimize your child, then it's some like you have to consider utilitarian type of things, like what's good for society and it'll probably be regulation about what kind of children you can have or not. Like your child can not have an IQ below this or above this or something like that. Or your child can not. We already kind of do that with VIP clubs. Like, ah, you're kind of ugly or women go, hey, he's not tall enough. We kind of do it a little. Yeah. Especially sexually. Yeah, we do. Can't get on the roller coaster if you're this short, whatever it is. You know, we do it in some capacity. But here, this would be like fully transparent and to a degree that it's hard to imagine. Like the way we currently do it, you can at least get around it. Yes. You can at least trick your way onto the roller coaster even if you're short. Right. Or the fat guy can get rich so he can get laid. You know, there's other ways. At the risk of asking the totally wrong person this question, what advice would you give to young people today in high school and college about how to have a successful career or career they're proud of or maybe have a life that they're proud of? Ooh. Well, first of all, you gotta be, you gotta want a life you're proud of. Not everybody has any integrity. A lot of people just want short money. I wanna feel good, look good right now. I wanna do Molly, boom, I'll feel good, you know? But you should space it out. You should, it's almost like saving money so you can use it later. Nobody wants to save money. What do they say, like 11% of America actually has money saved, $1,000 or some shit? It's wildly low. Everybody wants it now, now, what do you call it? Immediate gratification. I think the key to happiness and satisfaction is working for something. Even if it's, it's like a baby. If you could have a baby in five minutes, if a woman, you got a, you jizzed in her and she had a baby, oop, five minutes, boom. Newborn, healthy. I think you'd be more likely to throw it away if you could make it that quick. It's the fact that you spent nine months backbreaking the labor, the lactating, the ripped placenta and the hymen or whatever the fuck. That's what makes you love it. And I think it's the same with comedy or making money or whatever. Look at these kids who like child stars. They all become heroin addicts at like 22 because they've just, their sensors are burned out. Their pleasure sensors. You didn't have to earn it. I think earning it is a big part of life and always try to do better, try to do more, try to learn new things. Hey, I'm bored. Life sucks. Play the piano then you chooch. But you won't do it because it takes effort and failure and all that. But that's the good part. And I know it's hard to see. So I think that's a good key to life is work hard at something you care about and then love the result. The hard work, the journey is actually way more important than just getting something. Everybody wants to go on Amazon. I got a package. Then you feel good for 10 seconds and all right, let's go on Amazon again. And then it's just a dumb cycle of you being disgusting and gluttonous. So work for it. Everybody wants to take steroids and just boop, I'm buff. Why'd you point at me? Well, I'm just saying. Because I'm Russian or what? Well, I saw the Icarus. But no, I'm not saying you're on roids. I'm just, you'd be way bigger. But I'm just saying, you know, work for something. And then I would also, young people eat shit early. Eat shit early. I know a guy who kind of got canceled or whatever and he had an out early, but he tried to get by and he tried to ride it and it all came crumbling down. But if he had eaten it early, like, yeah, I fucked up. I did that. Whatever it was, he would've just kind of been shit on for a month and then it would've gone away. But now it's his whole identity and that sucks. So eat shit early. And I know it's hard to see, what do you mean early? I'm in the present. But look ahead, look back, this time will pass. I mean, look at high school. High school was the biggest thing in our lives. Oh my God, this exam, Susie Q hates me. The football player beat me up. Oh, I'll never recover. Now you don't even think about high school. It's just a blip in your dumb life, you know? And that's what this is now. This will just be a blip. So remember that and work towards something and work hard and care about the result. If the result isn't good, try it again. And failure is not always bad. Failure, we look at failure as this end all, be all. My life's over, I failed. But failure is really just learning. So that's something. So in summary, eat shit early and eat shit often. Yes. All right, Mark Norman. Eat ass. That's escalated quickly. All right, I have a list of random questions for you. What activities make you lose track of time? Oh. Have that go into that zone. You have this happiness, contentment about you that you just truly enjoy. Yeah, I think a good conversation. Like I'll sit at the comedy cellar with friends, maybe a little whiskey's flowing. And when you're really just vibing and inhibiting. You can do it. What is it? Inhibited. Inhibited. Uninhibited. Uninhibited. When you're just vibing and you're uninhibited and you're saying crazy shit and you're laughing and you're not worried, am I seeming cool right now? Am I seeming likable? When you're just you 100% and it's all coming out of you and then they're saying stuff and you go back and forth and you feel that excitement. Oh, they're talking, but I wanna say my thing. And you get all peed up. I love that. And I look at my watch, I'm like, fuck, it's three in the morning. We've been talking for five hours. So I love that. That makes the time fly by. Also, I bought a, speaking of self driving cars, I bought a 1973 BMW car and it's classic and it's stick shift and it's grizzly and gritty and rusty and it's a bucket of bolts, but I love driving it. Bucket of bolts. Yeah. You and Tom Waits are poets. Have you taken like a long trip anywhere, like road trip in your life or with this BMW? Not with it, it's pretty new, but I will. It's a new 97. Yeah, it's new to me. And it goes in the phase of everything we're doing now. Everything is digital, everything is automated, everything is hands off, everything is delivered. And this is the most hands on thing in the world. And I am dialed in, man. I got the tachometer, I keep an eye on that. Oh, I put the wrong gear in, shit. Oh, it's about to stall, put some gas, put some clutch. And it's all just brain power and staying in focus and all that, and it's the opposite of tweeting and texting and watching porn or whatever. So I almost needed that in my life, so I bought this car just to have this little exercise. I hope you don't mind that I'm just trying out random questions I wrote on you that are completely insane. I'm a guinea pig, jizz in my face. Bring it on, baby. This would be edited down to five minutes. If everyone on earth disappeared and it was just you left, what would your days look like? What would you do? That's tough, because I'm already an introvert and I try to avoid people mostly. Like I like a one on one, but crowds and all that is tough. So. So basically unchanged? Yeah, that's what I was gonna say, but then that's the irony is I would be so sad to not talk to anybody. So it's this weird, bittersweet thing, but I don't know what I would do, man. I guess it's kind of like when you're hung over, you just go into the primal survival mode. I gotta get food, I need water, I'm horny, jerk off. You just go, you're not like playing the piano or painting or at the gym. So I think I would just go into urges, man, primal urges. Find food, store food, am I safe? Make weapons, build a shelter that I can't get attacked in. I would go all survival mode. And then once I maybe realized if I was safe or not, there's no wild roaming dogs, I would start exploring. And maybe somehow get a vehicle and I would try to expand and that would be it. And maybe I'd journal. Exploring to what, to try to find new experiences? New life, if there's other, maybe there is another guy out there. Oh, so always there's a possibility. Yeah, hope. Hope. And then maybe there's a better place I could live. Let's find that and then moving on. Maybe there's more food over here. So yeah, the hope would drive me. But it would be bleak and sad and horrible also. So what you're saying is you really want other people to be there so you can hide from them, isn't it? Yes, yes, well said. All right, what's an item on your bucket list that you haven't done yet? Think about something you'd be very upset if you died and you haven't done. Well, I'm terrified of having kids, just because I'm a child myself and I'm selfish and lazy in a way. So kids are like, this is your whole life now, this is it. You gotta not let this thing die. You gotta love it, you gotta raise it. So kids scare the shit out of me, but I also feel like if I don't have them, I'll regret it. Well, you've seen so many people like you who are fundamentally changed by kids. Like it's a source, it's a source of, like a deep source of happiness, even though you didn't anticipate it. Yeah. So you like, you penciled it into your bucket list. Yes, yes. You're, it might be on there. Okay. You want kids? Yeah, well, I want kids. I wanna get married, I wanna have kids. I kind of, I don't like choice. So in the following way, like I appreciate the value of scarcity and the power of scarcity. Like I don't like the modern dating culture. It's not some religious thing or whatever. I just like one girl for a long time or at least swinging for that always, like swinging for the fences. You could be swinging right now. I mean, you're. There's a different use of the word swinging. Sure, sure. What I'm saying, you could be clear. You look great, you're handsome. Yeah, thank you. Muscular. Thank you. You get the job done. So I feel like you wouldn't leave without an orgasm on her. Yeah, but I just like to, you know, about furries. I like to dress up as animals and I just have trouble finding others who like the same. They're up there. I could show you some chat rooms. You're also my coach for the internet. Okay. What are you most afraid of? I guess on Unlived Life. I was a big fan growing up of like wild guys, you know, like these Teddy Roosevelt's who would go out and hunt lions and like bar fighting guys. I was obsessed with the Hunter S. Thompson types. And look, this is what I love about guys like, who's a good example? Like Hemingway. Hemingway was the manliest guy. He had the rifle and the elephant gun and the whiskey and the writing and the women and the fist fights. But people forget that the other side of that coin is I'm sure he was in a lot of hotel rooms weeping. I'm sure he was lonely as fuck. I'm sure he had some wicked hangovers. I mean, he killed himself for Christ's sake. So obviously he was dealing with something. So the key to me is having this adventurous life, living to the fullest, doing crazy shit, scaring yourself, but also not killing yourself. Like also not hating, because I used to party a lot hard. I used to bang a lot of gals. And the flip side is like, this girl hates you now, or you got herpes or you're hungover, or your mom is like, where are you? You never call me anymore. You're like, oh, my mom, let ties go with my mom. I gotta connect. So there's a horrible side to the party animal. The Keith Richards we don't see is not pretty. I mean, he's already weird looking, but he's partying, he's smoking, he's living. But there's another side of that coin. And I think the key to life is living that fucking crazy, awesome, badass life, and also having some meaning and a little bit of, what's the word? Not just not killing yourself, not going sad, not being depressed. There's a medium there, a sweet spot. Does that make sense? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So taking big leaps and Hemingway, grabbing life by the balls, but at the same time, not crushing the balls, does that metaphor work at all? Perfect, like Evel Knievel, we all know him. What a badass, fearless, oh, man, what a cool dude. He's got balls of steel. But he also lived the back half of his life in a fucking barka lounger where his legs were made of steel and he couldn't see straight and his dick didn't work. So you know what I mean? You gotta have a balance, but you still want the balance. I'm willing to take a little bit of shit for a little bit of fun, but you don't want to go too hard. Well, you gotta still risk it. I mean, Hunter S. Thompson, it didn't end well. Yeah. But it was quite a ride. Quite a ride. What small act of kindness were you once shown that you will never forget? Wow, that's a great question. I just wrote these for the guinea pig. You're the guinea pig. That's great, that's a keeper. Keep that question. Okay, that's a keeper? Yeah. This is where we're like workshopping questions here. All right, I'll take it. Now you're open biking. Yeah. This is your version. Let's see, there's a couple ladies in high school who were kind enough to hand job me. That was nice, which I really appreciate. I don't think women know how much that means to us. You know, women are like, oh, I'm not a piece of meat or whatever. And you're like, I know, but if you just gave me a hand job, it would make my world. It's like telling a kid he's smart or loved. See, most people mention like a math teacher, middle school, that would inspire them to get into science. You give a shout out to the thing. Well, that's part of it, that's not the nicest, but I'm just saying that goes a long way. All right. Let's see, kindness. That's a great question. I wanna give you a good answer. I got lost when I was like six. I was walking around my dad and I zoned out and went away. And next thing you know, I don't know where I am. I'm in a neighborhood. This old guy finds me crying on a lawn somewhere and he goes, come inside. And he tried to call my parents and nothing came of it. Eventually they found me after like nine hours, cops were there, the FBI is out there, fucking helicopters. And I guess, you know, that's nice. This old guy took me in for a couple of hours and just sat me down and kept me safe. That's something. Yeah. Oh, how about Enis? My transvestite nanny, very kind. He, did you hear about this? No. We had this transvestite nanny who was like a drag queen, but it was in the 90s. So it was weird. It was new. And my bike got stolen and he, you know, my parents were like, eh, what are you gonna do? They're poor kids, you know? And he was like, fuck it, we're gonna go get that bike. And I was like, this guy's in a wig and high heels, big black guy. And I'm like, ah, what are you gonna do? You know, it's gone. And he's like, nah, we're gonna go get it. So we got in the van and drove around my neighborhood, saw the kids, fuck with the bike, you know, five street tufts. And he goes, all right, you want to come out or should I just do this? And I was like, you do it. I'm terrified. What are you, crazy? And he got out of the van in full, you know, heels and wig. And he went up to these guys and they went off. Oh my God, look at this fucking guy, homo faggot, all this shit. You know, it's the 90s. And he just stared at them long enough to where they were kind of like, all right, well, I guess we're gonna fight you now. And he goes, that's not your bike. And they go, what are you gonna do about it? And he puts his hand on the middle of the bike and they didn't do anything. And he just picked it up and said, that's what I thought. Put the bike over his shoulder, slid the van door open, threw the bike in and we drove off. Somebody stuck up for you. Yeah, and you know, I mean, he could have got, I mean, they had tools. They could have fucking tuned him up, two seconds. That actually like takes courage. Oh yeah, real courage. And then that, the reason you do an act like that is that makes a kid like you feel like there's somebody on your side, that's powerful. Someone on your side is big. Is big. That goes a long way. Especially when they have the risk of getting their ass kicked or their job taken away or whatever it is. Now we're gonna get philosophical, maybe a little bit emotional. Oh, would you rather lose all your old memories or never be able to make new ones? It's a tough one, but I'd go easy answer, make new ones. But don't you think all the shitty things that happen to you? Oh, so my hard drive is wiped clean. It's not, is it memories or is it how every memory affected me too? I mean, this is a very. Or do they go hand in hand? I think the reality about memories is you replay them often. You go back to them even when you're not aware of it. You really go, you go back often like that. And they change. You change them too. Yeah, you change them to suit your understanding of the world. Yes. And so the dark view you have, both the hope and the cynicism you have about the world is so deeply grounded in the memories that you're basically, I would say, if you erase all memories, I think you're really starting over with maybe the wisdom of how the world works, but not so much of your personality is gone. You would really, it'd be interesting how your comedy would change. Maybe you would have a good sense of timing. You have a good sense of the writing process maybe. But like. Now you're making some good points, but let me ask you this. Let's say I go to Lake Cuomo with my girlfriend. Now, like I wipe the memory or I keep my old memories. Let's say I go to the Tuscany with the lady. I just won't remember that? Yeah, but you get to experience it in the moment. Okay. You'll get to enjoy it. Can I look at a photo of it? Yes. But I would, what the hell is this? Yeah, exactly. Oh, fascinating. It's exact. The rules are pretty simple. Yeah. I think everyone knows how the rules go. So you would, yeah, so what? Well, I was gonna say start new ones, but then I realized I wouldn't be who I was without them. That's what you're saying. So I guess I'd keep them. Cause I am 38, so I've gotten a good chunk out of life. Yeah. And let's be honest, how many years do you have left? I know, right? I got AIDS. Is it better to have loved, okay, this question is ridiculous. Is it better to have loved than lost or to have never loved at all? It sounds cliche, but there's a question. Definitely better to loss. So you enjoy the ups and downs. Yeah, that's life. We're sun and rain, baby. I kind of like both, the whole thing. The loss, every time you lose something, it really makes you distinctly realize how much you valued it. Yes. Like when I'm feeling alone and I'm sitting there alone at home and I wish I could hang out with somebody, that's like a realization how awesome people are. Yeah. So it's like the missing, yeah. We don't have a lot of that in life anymore because we can have anything we want immediately. So the missing has gone away, which again drives down the joy of having it. So I think you're right, you need both. So like you said, you have a terminal condition, not many years left. Do you think about your mortality? You think about that? All day, every day. Are you afraid? Not afraid, because it's inevitable. So it's more like, how are we gonna handle this? It's like the winter is coming, let's stock up on some fucking nuts. But the existential nature of it, like the fact that this ride ends, like what the hell are you doing any of this for? Like, is it your? Satisfaction, happiness. Short term, but like there is a presumption there that it kind of goes on forever. I think if you truly think about the fact that it ends. Your brain almost shuts it down. Yeah, there's some kind of like protective like switch that just goes off. I mean, that's why the Stoics encourage people to meditate on death, because it somehow reorganizes your priorities. It helps you like, holy shit, this ends, make the most of the day. It's just a nice thing, but still you can't quite comprehend that the thing ends. Little things too. People go like, oh, we got a layover between our flights. It's an hour, what are we gonna do for an hour? It's like, what do you mean, what are you gonna do for an hour? You're gonna kill an hour. How are we gonna kill this hour? This is part of your life. You're just trying to get rid of it, you're just trying to kill it. That always blew my mind. Like, hey, fuck it, let's go hit the airport bar. Let's get a candy bar or something, anything with bar. But it's just, you've gotta live. I hate this like, how are we gonna burn? Oh, the bar didn't open for 15 minutes. What are we gonna do? Well, we got 15 minutes. The world is our oyster. Yeah, make the most of it. And like you said, in modern day, actually the boredom is a gift. Like when you're waiting for something, that's a gift. You get to be with your thoughts. Yeah. Those are the same thoughts you'll have when you're on your deathbed. There won't be a, you won't be scrolling TikTok on your deathbed. I hope not, Jesus. You'd be a lot more, actually maybe you would be. What a sad existence. Because it would be a good, like content creators would be like, ooh, I'm dying, this would be good content. Yeah, I wanna be able to sure, film the exact moment it goes, beep. Like last words, I wonder what my last words will be. It'd be a good way to like end the account with a bang. Yep, I like that. Well, you know that you ever seen that meme where the old guy in bed, he goes, I wish I had tweeted more, you know, and then he dies. It's so true. Could be the future. What do you think is the meaning of life? I don't think there is one. Everybody always throws that out there. There isn't a meaning. I think we're here, we're lucky to be here. I think there's no afterlife, there's no heaven. That's all shit we tell ourselves to feel better. And I think you gotta just, it's like saying, what is the meaning of this food I made? Well, it's just you enjoy the food, you try to get the most out of it. You built the food, you prepared it. So just get what you can out of it. Don't die and try to make it last as long as possible. Yeah, but you look at Earth, it's like 4 billion years old. And life started early on, like simple cell bacteria life, like 1 billion years in. And then it started like having lots of aggressive interaction. Eventually there's predator and prey and there's sex, lots of sex, lots of sex, lots of violence. Oh yeah. And then, you know, through natural selection, there's just the whole evolutionary process of animals that have loved and lost and murdered and gotten murdered and all that kind of stuff. And it's somehow led to human civilization. We're super busy trying to create things and creating beautiful art, creating beautiful comedy. Just always creating something new. It feels like it's tending towards something, like. It's not dying. If you die tomorrow, you still have all these hours of pods. So it's kind of, you think you're cheating death in a subconscious way, I think. Right, you know who Ernest Becker is and? I've heard the name. It's a book called Denial of Death, this idea that if you don't acknowledge. Books on my shelf. Girls love it. Like Dostoevsky. No, I'm just, I'm saying. You want to bring Tolstoy, Dostoevsky? Russian literature, it's back to norm. It's good to bring to, because no American has read any Russian literature, but they all appreciate it if you bring it. And it's not like they're going to ask you any legitimate questions because they haven't read it. So you can always pretend like you've read it, so. It's a little dense. Can we get a shortened version? Cliff notes. Yes, or make a movie with, you know, Ben Stiller that I can just go, oh, this is based on, what is it, life and death? No, what's the one? War and peace. War and peace, yeah. Yeah, so Ernest Becker's theory, and there's this whole terror management theory that basically says that like our terror of death, our fear of death is one of the central creative forces of the human condition. It's the reason we're trying to, yeah, cheat death. We're trying to dilute ourself that somehow we can become immortal through our art. That's why you've uploaded your special to YouTube because you think your special will outlive all of human civilization. You think YouTube will outlive all of human civilization. That could go away tomorrow. That can go away tomorrow. All of this can go away. So I'm truly grateful. Mr. Mark Norman, that you would spend your very valuable time with me today even though it could all go away. This could be the last day of our lives, and won't you be quite upset that this is how you spent it? Ah, yeah, in your hotel room, what am I? You're like Harvey Weinstein here. You poured me up, and now I feel fucked. Just wait, what we have ready for you after the podcast is over. All right, brother, thanks so much for talking today. Thank you, it was great. Comedy. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Mark Norman. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from Mark Norman himself on his Twitter, which you should definitely follow because it's hilarious. The worst thing about getting Omicron for Christmas is you know it was regifted. Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time. Yeah, yeah, yeah, he's good. But basically, just the absurdity of it all. Lots of money, lots of weirdos, degenerates, and dreamers, and the whole mix of it. Do you think that's an accurate description of what New York is today? Like, is there still place for the weirdos and just the interesting artists, the edgy, the comedians, the creators, the entrepreneurs, as opposed to like Wall Street, as opposed to like rich folk, and then like hopeless folk? Yeah, I think it's definitely changed a lot. There's a tiny corner for us weirdo artists. New York used to be where you went to make it as a painter or whatever, a comedian or a singer. And there were all these dives and shit boxes and all these places you could go. And now it's more Pink Berries and Subway Sandwiches and Chase Banks. So it's definitely lost a lot of its creative edge. It's just money, money keeps coming in. And now you see all these comedians move to Nashville, Austin, Denver, whatever. So it doesn't have the power it used to have of like, you gotta be here if you wanna make it. That's definitely gone. So that hurt the city a lot. The city is way more soulless. When I moved here in 07, I mean, not only did I get mugged three times in the first year, but it was a hub of like, it felt like things were happening here. It was an energy, it was electricity. And we still have the electricity, but it's also maybe just cause there's Times Square, there's Soho, there's Wall Street. So we got the staples, but there is a little bit of that. It's almost like a marriage. Like, yeah, we're in love, but it's not as passionate as it once was. That's how I would equate New York. What gives you hope? You're pretty hopeful about it though. I'm hopeful just cause I know it's magical and I think it has to be. I mean, it's the epicenter of America. Like this is where the immigrants came and this is where the stock market is and the entertainment industry, a lot of it is here. So I think it's gonna happen, but something like the bottom has to fall out and then people have to move back here and all that. So something, the corporations are kind of fucking us. They're just buying everything. Well, that's true for everything. That's true for everything. This is true for Austin probably as well. People are just buying out land and all that kind of stuff. You always hear a Hemingway and Dali and all these guys went to Paris in the 20s or whatever that was. I get it now. I used to be like, why do these guys go to Paris? Why do these artists? And now I get it. Cause it's like, it's freer there. That's why Austin became like that Paris where everybody's like, I gotta get out of LA. I'm going there. And maybe, but we came back from that. 70s were wild and 90s were cool. So maybe it'll come back. Might just take a decade. Well, there's always, that's how stories are told. There's always pockets of like Paris within New York. True, true. There's just an opportunity to let your weird flourish is there in New York, I'm sure. There, I mean. It's there. You gotta find it. Before it was front and center. What's your favorite thing about New York? Like what kind of things just like. I mean, how long is this pod? I could go on. It's just, it's too much to put into one hour. We've got other questions, but I love that one neighborhood is wildly different than the next. I'm in Little Italy and then you take four steps. Now I'm in Chinatown. I mean, and then the history there and then the stories and the food and the culture and all that. And then you go 10 feet over here. Now you're in Brooklyn. And this is insane as a whole nother world. And it's almost like a little America in one, you know, city and it's great. And just the fact that they pulled it off like Fifth Avenue goes way up. And you're like, there's a billionaire's house next to a hobo. And then this is a black guy who's fighting with a Cuban guy and an Asian guy is trying to get in the middle of them. And the cabbie's from the Middle East. And there's so many beautiful women here. And there's so many brilliant minds here. And the pace is great. It keeps people moving. I mean, it just, you can't beat it. And the city will fuck you in the ass too. Don't get me wrong. You landed JFK and you're like, oh God, I got mugged. My Uber driver called me a homo. I stepped in human shit. Where the fuck am I? So yeah, it's bad news. But that bad news, it's almost like the bullying. It kills you in a weird way, but it makes you stronger. And you build more layers and layers and layers. That's why some new guys, some hayseed from Milwaukee shows up. You've been here 10 years and you go, let me help you out. Cause you gotta adjust. You're gonna get your ass kicked for like six months. But I know the ropes a little, and I think you need a little of that. If the treadmill's not on, you're not gonna run. New York, the treadmill's on. So it just makes you run and it makes you better. And look, it wears on you. You probably lose 10 years of your life living in New York versus Indianapolis, but it's a better life. Have you seen 25th Hour? Yeah, it's been a while. Spike Lee joint. Yeah, Spike Lee joint. I mean, at Norton, there's a whole monologue there about New York. Oh, that's right. They're talking about just, he has like a mix. There's like melancholy music, I think, or just a melancholy feel to the whole thing. But there's an anger and a disgust with the city. But through the anger and the disgust comes out like a love for the city. Same with, was Taxi Driver in New York? Oh yeah, it's going crazy. Yeah, so like that, there's something about, what is that? What is that grit of the city that like pushes you down? Well, that's the beauty of this city is it's this tribal human nature, like the sex shops and fistfights and racism and all this tension, but yet it's the epicenter of technology and finance and sophistication on Fifth Avenue. So you get that juxtaposition. It's kind of like in Boston. You go to Boston, they got MIT, they got Harvard, they got all this shit. And then they got the fishermen, the blue collar douchebags, the Irish guys, the immigrants, and you get that mix of like insanely smart with wicked pisser and these two worlds. And that's a good thing. It's like when a black guy fucks an Asian lady, that's a good looking kid. You get a mix. We're mixing two totally different things are coming together and it makes it, it's like peanut butter and chocolate. Peanut butter and chocolate, I've never tried that. What? Peanut butter, maybe I have. You're talking about Reese's, man. Like Reese's, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, it's the best candy. Yeah, without the fakeness of LA, without the kind of, with the facade. Yeah, LA's tough. What's the difference between LA comedy and New York comedy to you? I think one place you kind of go to make it and be discovered and be loved, and one place you go, you can get all that in New York too, but I think in New York, it's more of a school, a bootcamp of comedy. Let's make great comedy. Let's make original comedy. Let's watch the other guys and gals who are at the show at the clubs and learn from them and try to hang out with them and absorb some of them. And in LA, it's like, when am I on? I'm next, get out of my way. I'm the star here. I'm a bigger star than you. Oh, this guy's actually a big star. I got to outwork, you know, it's just a lot of that instead of like, damn, that was funny. I got to be that funny. Damn, I wish I had a joke. And look, I don't want to speak for LA comics because there's, you know, Bill Burr, Anthony Jeslenek, brilliant LA comic, but they all cut their teeth in New York, just saying. Then they moved to LA. That's a good point. You know, Ali Wong, all these people, killer comics, but New York, started in New York, moved to New York. There is something about comics that stay in New York for a long time though, like Dave Attell. Ah, you know about Dave? Yeah, yeah, he wants to do this podcast. He does? Yeah, I'm a huge fan of Dave Attell. But it's like, he almost like he doesn't want to make it. I don't know. I mean, you probably know him, but like, it feels like you just, maybe it's romanticizing it, but you're like, you almost just love the art of comedy, like becoming funnier, crafting the jokes, becoming funnier than the other comics, like competing with each other kind of thing, not over like money or fame or any of that, just purely the comedy of it. Totally, that's Dave. That's him in a nutshell. He's like that guy in the movies in the 80s, action movies, where they're like, they go up to a creek in Montana, and some guy's living in a cabin, and he's sharpening a stick, and they go, the Russians are coming, they're invading. We need you, you're the best commando. And he's like, I gave that up, man. I'm done with that lifestyle. They're like, but you're the best, we need you. And he has to suit up eventually. You know, he looks at a picture of his dead wife, and he goes, fuck it, I'm going. And then they, you know, fight the Ruskies. But he's that guy. He just is gifted. He's like got a gift from Allah, and he's the best. Yeah, a lot of comics give him props. That's always surprising to me. Because it's surprising to me because he hasn't really made it, like big. Well, he did. In the 90s, he was huge. He had his own TV show. Yeah, yeah, that show was awesome. But I mean, like as big as I think he deserves to be. Well, that's art. The mainstream shit is always the worst. It's like McDonald's versus some hole in the wall. I know I'm shitting on McDonald's again, but it's good. And you know, certain comics we could name are good, but the delicacy is going to be less talked about and less household namey than the mainstream hacky shit. Yeah, it's funny because he hasn't, I think it was on Joe Rogan's show once, maybe. Yeah, once or twice. And he was with somebody else. Jeff Ross? Yeah, he might have known Jeff Ross. Oh yeah, because they did that like two mics thing, whatever. Oh, big mics, yeah. Yeah. But he's the quickest guy. There's no one funnier. Yeah. Yeah, him and you, you're super quick. Your appearance on, recent appearance on Rogan's hilarious. Oh, thanks. Just so fast. You're on with Ari and... Shane Gillis. Shane Gillis. Yeah, that was fun. We're going back in January. I don't know when this comes out. This has never come out. Neither will you. We're having fun. Yep. All right, so what does it feel like to bomb in standup comedy, like to fail? Maybe the psychology of it first, like just take me through it. Cause we're talking about being outnumbered in a fight, just being beat up. Very similar. By the way, this is like a no eye contact off. Yeah, we're both uncomfortable with it. Yeah, it's great. It's kind of nice to be with my people, but yeah. Do you need a sheet of paper to look at it? I'm going, I got a good sweet spot right there. Yeah, it's a nightmare, but it's part of it. It's the validation too is the worst part. Cause you know, whenever you do comedy and kill, you can be a great comic, but even David Tell, these brilliant guys, they feel like they're getting, you feel like you're getting away with something. I don't have a day job. I'm telling jokes for a living. I'm talking about my dick up here and they're fucking loving me. And they call me a genius and all this. I'm talking about my sack, you know? And it's great. It makes people happy and it's funny, but that bombing, when you bomb, your first thought is like, yeah, you're right. At first you're like, fuck you guys. What, you don't like this shit? And then you just start going in. You're like, man, maybe it isn't that good. Maybe they're right. I do suck. I knew I sucked. I should become a mailman, you know? And it stinks and you feel alone. And you feel like you wasted their time. And then you're like, what was I thinking? I could be a comedian. What the fuck, who am I? You know, Eddie Murphy, what am I doing here? So it's a lot of just spiraling out of horrible thoughts. But I also love that it hurts so bad. Bombing fucking hurts because now everybody doesn't do it. I think a lot more people could do comedy probably and figure it out. But the bombing is so brutal that it keeps, one time I went to Minneapolis. I was like, this is a great city. I mean, it's a sun is shining. Why isn't this city like packed? And they're like, cause the winters are so bad and we love it because it keeps everybody out. And I feel like the same about comedy. The bombs are so brutal. I've had bombs where I'm in bed. I'm just staring at the ceiling like, what the fuck was that? Like you have PTSD. I bombed at an arena once, 20,000 people. I did 30 minutes to silence. I guess. So it's not just like one joke fails. It's like they start piling on like it's irrecoverable. Yes. And one joke failing is very common. Like a lot of audience don't even notice like that bomb. Cause you get, you know, you've got so many jokes in a row. You can sandwich a good one, then a bad one, then a good one. But when you bomb, it's almost like they chose, we don't like you. Nothing you say will redeem yourself. And it's hard to get out of. It's like being pulled down by your hair. You can't get back. I can't win this fight no matter what. Can you like get them back by acknowledging like the elephant in the room that like. That helps, but they're still gonna go, that was funny when he made fun of it, but he sucks. He still sucks. He still sucks. That's the worst part. You're going, no, this is good. You guys just don't like me. Just cause you don't like me doesn't mean I'm bad. Yeah, I like going to open mics a lot. Just listening because first of all, I think the audience in open mic, at least the ones I've been to, is mostly I guess other comedians or like at least people who don't seem to want to laugh at anything. And so I just love it because it's human nature and perseverance that is best. That here's comedians, like clearly, this is mostly in Austin. They have a dream. Like why would you get up there? Right, maybe some weird, you know, New Year's resolution bullshit, but for the most part, it's people who want to be comedians. Like a lot of the open micers are people who clearly have done this for quite a long time already. Like at least a year or two, maybe five years. And they're often not very funny. And just bombing in front of an audience of like 20 where they're just sitting there, like almost like mocking them with their eyes or maybe, and I don't know, and they still push through. They still like, as if they're doing an arena and everybody's laughing. They still got that energy trying. Almost like to an audience that doesn't exist. Like an audience of their dreams. Cause I guess that you have to do that to keep the energy of the act going. And it's just so beautiful to watch them try it. And also what happens, open mic, I don't know, five minutes, whatever they do, they walk off and then walk back off stage. And like, you can't, who do they look at? Like what do you look at, do you make eye contact with people, do you? You look at your phone, you look at your feet, you just zone out. You kind of kind of go white, you know, you just hear white noise and go out. It's tough, but you got it. You need a little delusion to be a comedian. To get into it, it takes a little bit of delusion. Like you think you can do this, you know, you got 10 years ahead of you of hell and you're up for this. And you know, most comics, we see a horrible crowd and we see our friend bomb and we go, yeah, he's bombing, but I'll get him. I'll get him. And then you don't get him, but that's human nature too. It's like, they don't like him, but they'll like me. And you need a little of that to keep going as a comedian. But you don't want too much delusion because then you're a psycho, but you need a little. Well, the psycho could be good for a comedy. That's true too, love psychos. I mentioned to you offline that I talked to Elon and we talked about doing standup, but he's thinking maybe do a few minutes of standup. I was gonna say, if you need a coach, Elon, I gotcha. Well, maybe you should move to Austin to coach him full time. Ah, hopefully he can fly me in. So what advice would you give to somebody who wants to try to do five minutes, like the early steps of trying to go to an open mic and say something funny? Well, that's the irony of comedy is, I don't know if it's irony, but it's like the beginning is the hardest part. Usually the beginning is easy part. Hey, I'm playing this level of Mario. I start, I jump over one Koopa Troopa, whatever. And then the end is like, Jesus Christ, I got 30 guys coming at me. Comedy is the opposite. The beginning is like, it's a gauntlet. It's just obstacles. And it's like you said, open mics. I watched these famous comedians on Netflix and you go, this would all bomb at an open mic. They're killing in Radio City. This would bomb at an open mic. That's the weird part. So it's almost like you have to go through hell just to get to the promised land. And I would say, rehearse the shit out of it because you're gonna get frazzled up there. Everybody thinks, oh, this is good material. But you also forget about the other part of delivering it, having confidence, being likable, having timing, having a cadence, figuring out who you are, figuring out what the audience thinks you are or how they perceive you. Cause you can go up there and say all this, but they go, why is the guy, he's clearly gay. Why is he acting like he's not gay? That's all, now they're not listening to the joke. So like, you gotta know how you look. And it's just repetition, repetition. And bombing is not failure. That's what you gotta remember. I mean, look, if you do a killer hour and then you take it to Netflix and bomb, you fucked up. But bombing is not failure. It's just data. It's going, oh, okay, I gotta retool that. That didn't work. Something's wrong there. I missed a word there. So you gotta treat the act almost like ingredients in a cooking, in a dish. You know, like, oh, I put too many eggs in. Take an egg out. You gotta treat it like that. And look, when you pull a bad cake out of an oven, you go, I fucked up. But it doesn't hurt your feelings. But when you bomb and fuck up, it hurts your feelings. So you gotta factor that in too. Your feelings gonna be hurt and just almost be a robot and just keep going towards that open mic. You know how scary an open mic is? Bombing sucks, but bombing in front of other comedians is way worse. Cause they know what just happened and they could have saved you and they didn't. So it's way worse. And they're gonna be your quote unquote friends for this journey. Yeah, no, these are evil people. Twisted, fucked up, hurt people. Can you tell, like in those early days, let's just talk about that, like at the open mic level that a joke is gonna be good on paper. Like I'll give you my experience cause maybe you could be my coach in this particular moment. So. Like Larry Nassar. That's fun, huh? Joking, everybody. I hope nobody takes it seriously. I now have an amazing team of folks who help me with editing and they're now currently sweating. Watch this. We gotta leave that one in. That was quick. Yeah, that was pretty good. I'll leave that one. That was good. All right. So going in front of an audience, just even to give a lecture terrifies me, which I've done. But open mic, I mean, that to me, perhaps that's why I like going to open mics and listening is cause I just, it terrifies me so much, that idea of going up there and bombing. I mean, it's scary. And to do even like one minute, to be honest, is scary. And five minutes, I'm also watched enough open mics to realize that five minutes is a long time. I mean, it depends on your comedy, but if you're doing fast stuff, five minutes is a really long time. Oh, it's eternity. I guess with a long story, too, is a long time because if the story's not working, you're building up to something. If the story's gonna fail, you just spent all that time telling the story that completely went flat. Completely. Got nothing. I guess if you have a series of jokes, you can at least try to recover and like do the Mitch Hedberg thing where like, all right, I'll cross that off. Yeah, yeah. Well, I'm able to, like I've tried to write a few things and I'm able to tell that it's really bad. Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha, well, that's better than most. Most people's egos kick in, they go, no, this is good. No, see, I'm able to introspect that. Like it seems funny. I mean, I guess the thing I'm looking for is original. Like there's easy stuff that you think is funny, but to me, originality is the thing you should be looking for because then, because then that's what's actually becomes funny. Like, or rather, if it's original, even if it bombs, that feels like more a beautiful art creation that you did. Like at least you swung for it. Like you did something unique. Cause like even with open mic, your first five minutes, there's so many, just go to enough open mics, you'll hear like all the, there's like a list of jokes that you can just go to. First of all, you can make fun of the fact that you're at open mic, that you're like doing this for the first time and so on. You could do a lot of stuff where you make fun of your appearance in some way and so on. But like, yeah, you could do that. You know, that takes actually, that's way harder than people realize to do it in an original way. Yes. You have to present who you are as a person very quickly, enough to then put that person down in front of everybody else. So you have to reveal the. The audience is like that, cause they go, he knows what we're thinking. Yeah, exactly. But do it again in an original way. And so like when I'm trying to write stuff, when I, not that I've tried long, it's like 30 minutes, but as enough to see like, oh shit, to write something original is really difficult. It is, but do you got a bit, anything? No. You didn't write any one line or anything? For this? No. Well, just in general, ever in your life, ever written a joke? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, okay. No, but I don't have anything in my mind popped up. So the jokes that I've written have more, like for some reason my mind goes to like dark places. So, you know, like, and not actually dark in the Mark Norman dark, because you go really dark to where it's like almost absurd. Yes. My natural inclination is to go to like a dark historical like place, like Hitler and Stalin. Yeah. And almost, so go to that place and then talk about something absurd there. So like, don't go like all the way, I don't know. I don't want to give examples because it'd be clipped, but the Mark Norman style, look it up. He has a special on his YouTube, that kind. I want to almost explore the dark aspects of human nature more kind of connected to actual historical figures. That's the inclination. Like, I don't know, Nature's Metal, the Instagram channel that explores like the darkness of nature, like something there. See, that's good that you already know that you've kind of gotten to the core of your comedy already. And that's interesting, that's a step ahead. Yeah, I can hear, with most things that I do in life, I can like hear the music from a distance, like in myself, like, okay, if you have anything, this is the direction it'll be without actually knowing exactly all the steps. And that's a nice motivation to be like, all right, well, if you do this for a long time, maybe you'll have a chance to get there. Right. But you have to, that's where it's a feature to be super self critical, I think. Yes. But then that's why it's fucking terrifying to walk up to a stage, stand there, and probably forget everything. Yeah, that's the other part nobody thinks about. Just goes right out of your head. You go fight or flight, it's ugly. My first years were horrific bombing, horrific stammering, horrific not remembering the punchline. Like, you got to, maybe you got a set up going and they're kind of on board and you're like, ah, how's that, ah, camera, camera out it goes. And you just hate yourself, it's a nightmare. But you've already kind of, maybe if you haven't done standup or whatever, but you kind of know your voice and that's pretty advanced. So you're not trying to be somebody else, I guess. Yeah, just for having done like podcasts and lecture and so on. That helps. I've embarrassed, I've already done some of the work of the standups do, which is embarrass yourself in front of others for prolonged periods of time. Yes. Yeah, so I've done that without actually developing the funny. Right, right, right. But maybe the funny just is not that difficult to develop. No, it's super difficult, of course, but I mean, maybe the essential work of a standup comedian is just the embarrassment of like finding who you are. Yeah, that's a part of it for sure. You know, in the beginning you're like, water bottle, what's funny about water bottle? Hmm, I'm a funny guy, I can make this funny, but that ain't, that's not it, you know? It's your shit, your shit, like your dark stuff. For me, I tend to gravitate towards dark, but in a weird way where, you know, people will say like, hey, don't objectify women. But then they go, Caitlyn Jenner's beautiful. And you're like, well, wait, I know something's off here. Why can you objectify her, but not the supermodel? So what's going on there? And I like to play with that. So I have this joke where I say, Caitlyn Jenner, oh, women go, Caitlyn Jenner's beautiful, beautiful woman. I go, well, you look like her, and they go, fuck you. And you're like, there's a lot of truth there. But I like exploring that kind of, oh, you're trying to get one over on me, or you're lying to yourself, or what are we doing here? And I like that kind of comedy. I don't see color, well, I'm black. No, you're not. Ah, you know, that's fun, because you're lying. Yeah, okay, so like big time comedians such as yourself don't like to think of yourself in this way, but. There we go. Yeah, this is like where you over philosophize comedy, but. Yeah, definitely. It seems like comedians. Don't say important. Nothing worse than a comedian who thinks they're important. Yeah, so I was going, I was trying to find, as I was trying to say these words, I realized how cliche it is and how uninteresting it is. So I'm going to just, but there is something. I'm worried this whole thing is uninteresting. I'm like, who cares about comedy? There's like six comics on the planet. That nobody cares. Okay, I trust you in the pilot seat. You know what you're doing. You got listeners. They've tuned out long ago. Oh, you got Dan Carlin on here, huh? Is he around? Yeah, we're just going back and forth on Twitter just now. He's a huge fan. He was on here before. He'll be back. I've been actually really trying to volunteer myself aggressively with Dan Carlin for like a Russian episode where I can speak Russian. There's certain documents. I talked with Jaco about this too. Certain things, I mean, I just love the challenge of bringing Russian documents that I can read in Russian and then can translate and can try to capture the depth of the writing in the Russian language and communicate to the American audience. So much is lost in translation. Like there's so much pain and poetry in the Russian language. It's just connected to the culture. Every language, not every language, but many languages are uniquely able to capture the culture of the people. I mean, in some way they're the representation of the culture of the people. And so Russian is definitely that, like represents the full history and culture of the 20th century with all the atrocities, all the broken promises, all those kinds of things. Norm says Russian literature is, it's the most tapped into human existence than anything else. Norm. McDonald. Yeah. The Russian literature guy. Dostoevsky, all that shit. It's funny that there is a gap with comedians too. There's a culture of Russian comedy, like standup comedians that are totally. Is that right? Yeah, yeah. I don't know these Russians. I mean, I don't know today. I mean, more from the 80s and 90s and there's a. Yakov. That's all I know. That's not, so there's like a force, that's. I've never seen you that offended. No, no, no, it's not offended. There's a different, there's like the kinesins and there's the edgy. Is that Russian? What do you mean? Wait, I thought you said there was Russian comics. Yeah, Russian, I mean, I'm comparing them. I'm giving you like a style of darkness, like that's the kind of people that kind of challenge. They give, again, this is to how important comedians are, is they give a voice to people where in the Soviet Union, you really can't like express your opposition to the government. And so comedians are exceptionally important there for just, I don't know, channeling the anger, even when sometimes it's not the actual opposition to the government, they're just channeling the anger, the frustration with the absurdity of life. Like, you know, when there's a shortage of food, shortage of jobs, the absurdity of the bureaucracy, like the top heavy government, just all of that can only sometimes be expressed with like dark, absurd humor. And that actually, why there's a culture of that kind of humor, you know, you gather around the table with vodka and all you can do is just talk shit and just. Be offensive, say horrible shit, ball bust. I mean, I make school shooting jokes and people go, how do you do that? I'm like, well, maybe that's how I deal with it. Yeah. You know, like how come I gotta empathize the way you do? Maybe we're different. All right, so now let's skip the whole open mic thing and crafting jokes. Oh yeah, that's tough. Kerouac said, one day I will find the right words and they will be simple. When do you know the joke is done, it's perfect. You're somebody that does like really sharp, like fast jokes. Wow. Oh, thanks. So like there's somebody, I don't know, I don't know who you see yourself in the same school as, like you're darker and faster than Hedberg, I think, in terms of like, just, I don't know, the turns you take are very fast. Thanks, I appreciate it. I think I got some Norm Macdonald and maybe. Oh, Norm, that's right. You know, obviously Norm, but Chris Rock was huge for me. Chris Rock, old like 90s Chris Rock was like, I didn't know you could do jokes like that. I always loved George Carlin and Groucho Marx and Bill Murray, there's so many different types of comedy. But when I saw the bigger and blacker bring the pain, I was like, oh my God, this is like, it hit me. So that was big. And then Norm's just like the funniest guy on the planet. So him being the smartest guy in the room, but acting dumb was great. So yeah, Chris Rock has that way of cutting to the bullshit, which I mentioned earlier. I liked that cutting through the bullshit kind of style of comedy, because you kind of go, oh, I'm not crazy. That's what I thought too. I was too scared to say it, but I thought that. And he's saying it in a room of people are laughing. Maybe I'm not an idiot. So that helped me. So it's observational, but not Jerry Seinfeld observational, it's like going to the darker thing. To like within society. But I like him too, but seeing it, doing it about stuff like in your life, society. Yeah, race, gender, government, politics, all that kind of stuff. Exactly, exactly, sex, human emotions, jealousy, whatever it is, that's the good stuff. How'd you feel when Norm passed away? Ah, that was a bummer because he was, you know what, 61. And I just didn't see it coming. And I just, I've watched so many hours of his stuff and I've met him and he's like, he was like this comedic bar, like, hey, we got Norm. You know, there's so much shit comedy. Then you see Norm and you're like, this is next level. This is savant type shit. And then to lose him is like, ah, Norm had 20 more years at least of just content and content and thoughts and his point of view. And that's, we'll never get that and that sucks. Yeah, there is something about artists like Jimi Hendrix dying too early. It's like, you wonder. What was next? Yeah, what was next? But then part of it is like, you know, it all ends for all of us and it's like walking away early is kind of admirable. It's almost like I did a pretty good job. Yeah. I'm good with that. And especially the way he did, which is not telling anybody. I know, nine years, his best friends didn't even know. And in this world of like victimhood and I need clicks and I need people to love me, he could have, he got, you know, canceled and yelled at and in trouble and he could have pulled that cancer card and he never did. I mean, the integrity on this motherfucker. Did you get a chance to interact with him? Like what, how often did you meet him? I met him once at the Comedy Cellar and we chatted for five minutes and then he went on and did the Letterman set that he did. He was running the Letterman set. And sweet guy, nice guy, didn't know him that well, but I mean, he's just brilliant. And I also love a brilliant guy who does stupid stuff. That's a fun, fun little combo there. Like silly guys who are actually brilliant also. You know, like Louis CK is a brilliant comic and he'll do a joke about farting on a kid. And you're like, that's great that he still finds farts funny and he's also this comedic genius guy. I like that. And doesn't really acknowledge the genius. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I like smart people, they're silly. Yes, that's a good combo. Like you said, Elon is silly. Yeah, yeah, super silly. Yeah, that's great. Cause we taught, we teach kids like, hey, put that down, stop that, quit cutting up, quit horsing around. But maybe that's some kind of sign of brilliance there. Yeah, being like childlike and silly is a kind of wisdom. I feel like those people are way wiser than the people that, no offense to me, wear a suit and take themselves way too seriously. No, but you got a spark in you. A little bit. You got a little, what's the word? Not elf, imp. Little imp in you. Give that a go. You know what imp? Little mischievous, it's like a little. Is that a Tolkien character, imp? Yeah, might be. An imp is a European mythological being similar to a fairy or a demon. Are you calling me a fairy? Frequently, no, okay. Similar to a fairy or a demon. I feel like that's a big leap. Big leap, yeah, that's not a great info bio there. Frequently described in folklore and superstition, the word may perhaps derive from the term imps, but with a Y, used to denote a young grafted tree. It's a little mischievous. You got a twinkle. You're the serious buttoned up guy, but there's a twinkle. There's a twinkle. And the audience can see the twinkle, and that's why you resonate, I think. I'm sorry. Deep Analysis by Mark Norman, Psychological Analysis. Okay, but then back to the crafting of the joke. You said Chris Rock and Norm Macdonald. What for you, how do you know when the joke is done? Are there some jokes that you're proud of? Wow, that's well done. Yeah, the joke is done. It's a tough question because there's so many different kinds of jokes. There's what we call a chunk, which is a big idea with a bunch of jokes in the middle of it, and then a big crescendo at the end. Or there's a one liner, or there's a tag of a joke that's also a joke. So the jokes come in different, like I have a joke where I say, I met my girl in that Jewish app. What's that Jewish app called? PayPal. Nice. That's the hell, that's what they're asking you to want from the crowd, but it's a fun turn because you say your thing and then I hit you with a misdirect and that's what a joke is. A joke is basically me saying something that makes sense, but you didn't see it coming. And that's a perfect example of that. So that joke took forever to figure out, by the way. You have to go to different services like PayPal. What's funniest? Exactly, and I figured PayPal is funny because it has the word pay in it. Venmo, it's also not really a good word, Venmo, PayPal. It just hits better. Yeah, PayPal is funnier somehow. It's funnier somehow, and that's the beauty of comedy. There's a weird little magic into it. You can get technical all day and formulaic, but there's still that little bit of fairy dust that you don't know why this is funnier. Or imp dust. Imp dust, yes. With a Y, okay. So you know what joke is done when it kills, and this is a roundness to a joke when you feel like this is buttoned up. This is done here. Is simplicity the right word there? Yeah. Is it like you're chopping stuff away or are you adding stuff? Like what does it feel like? Simplicity is always the best angle. I mean, you can get real high concept with a joke and still make it work, but the simpler the better. I saw Dave Chappelle on stage once, and Chris Rock and Demetri Martin were in the back watching in awe, and Dave Chappelle, I can't remember the joke, but he said something about sex or women, and Demetri Martin goes, eh, it's a little easy. And Chris Rock goes, that's why it's good. And I remember hearing that as some young comic, like ah, I'm getting this comedy lesson right here for these two titans. And so that was fun. Simple is key. So the easy is okay. That's such a weird, I think I remember reading or hearing Eminem say something about maybe the song Slim Shade. One of the songs, he's like, I knew it was gonna be good because it got really repetitive and annoying very quickly or something like that. I mean, that's the sort of the music equivalent of it's too easy. Like if it's like super catchy, as a musician, you might get very quickly bored of it. Or like as you're creating it, no, it's too easy. It's like there needs to be some more complexity to it. I like complexity, but the best guys who are the ones who make complex shit look simple. Like you ever heard that Ben Franklin story where he's talking to his friend, his friend's like, I'm gonna start a hat store. So he puts a sign out, says, hats for sale, $12. And Ben Franklin looks at it, he goes, well, you don't need the $12 because all they need to know is that you got hats for sale. He's like, all right. So he loses the $12, makes a new sign, hats for sale. And he goes, you don't really need for sale because it's a business. People can put that together. So he just goes, all right. He makes a new sign, it says hats.\n",

      "Text: you have to have the free markets in order to build prosperity. And prosperity means economic power. If you have economic power, no one messes with you. Or if they're gonna do it, they're gonna have to think twice and when they do, they're gonna have to pay consequences. The following is a conversation with Magat Wade, an entrepreneur who's passionate about creating positive change in Africa through economic empowerment. This is the Lex Friedman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Magat Wade. You were born in Senegal. You have lived and traveled across the world. So let me ask you, what is the soul of Senegal? Like, its people, its culture, its history. Can you try to sneak up on telling us what is the spirit of its people? Taranga, Taranga. Taranga, it's a Wolof word. Wolof is the main indigenous language of Senegal and it means hospitality. That is what us, the people of Senegal, are known for. And it transpires in everything that we do, everything that we say. It's a place where, I guess with hospitality, goes this concept of warmth. So we are a very warm people. So in a nutshell, that's us. That's us, the place where you come and everybody will just embrace you, make you feel very comfortable, make you feel like you're the only person in the world and that we've been waiting for you our whole life, right? So that's my country. So that's for people in Senegal, people in Africa, or also people across the world, weird strangers from all walks of life. So hospitality towards everyone. For everyone, for everyone. Especially towards the foreigner because it's very ingrained in us, this understanding that especially the foreigner, the foreigner is called foreigner because the foreigner is coming from somewhere else. So if someone has taken the time and the energy, whether in a forced manner or because it's a choice to travel so far to come to a place that's not theirs, to start where that's where the foreigners again, then it is your duty to welcome them, to be uber welcoming to them. So there's not a fear of the foreigner. There's not a suspicion of the foreigner. No, no, no. And I think this goes with the other way around. Maybe it has to do with just, you know, when you feel good about yourself, when you're very grounded yourself, it's very easy to open yourself to others. And I'm wondering if that's not, you know, the other side of the equation in a way. So no, we don't have a fear towards a foreigner. That's just no. When you have a pride of your culture, pride of your own people, it's easier to sort of embrace. I mean, it's interesting how these kind of cultures emerge because, you know, the Slavic countries are sometimes colder. They're slower to trust others. We're now here in Austin, Texas. One of the reasons I fell in love with this place when I showed up is there's that same hospitality as compared to other cities I've lived in, sort of Boston, Philadelphia, San Francisco. There's a hesitation to open up, to be fragile, to be caring before understanding what I can gain from you kind of calculation. It's really interesting. And I wonder how those kinds of dynamics emerge because they're certainly parts of the world. Like Austin is one of them where you just feel the kindness, just radiate without knowing kindness from strangers. You know, if I were to advance one thing, and I had the same experience after having lived in San Francisco first, then we went to New York, then we came to Austin. And when we came to Austin, I felt, it took me a while to put my finger on it, but what I found in Austin, people just hang. People, right? They're real. They're real. And like what you were saying, I feel like in these other places, people are, it's a destination for people who want to come and perform. I think maybe the early San Francisco people, it was different for them. But later as prosperity starts to come in and success comes in, then you attract a different breed. At first, we're the people who made it, who made this place be what it is. And then it attracts all the bling followers and the bling attracted people. And when those people show up, it's time for all of us to get out. And that's one of my worries about Austin too. And I guess I'm one of, I count myself in it, but you know, because we're also new arrivees, always been furious now. But how are we gonna protect this place? Yeah. Yeah, these are, you know, the best possible version of the Austin history. This is the early days of Silicon Valley in Austin. And so you get a chance to build on top of this culture that's already been here of the weirdos, the artists, the sort of the characters, but also the general kindness and love that just permeates the whole place, build on top of that entrepreneurial spirit. So like the tech companies, new startups, all that kind of stuff. And then you get a chance to build totally new ideas, totally revolutionary ideas and make them a reality and dream big and build it here. I think Elon represents that with all the people that kind of try to do the cutting edge stuff they're doing at Tesla and SpaceX. But there's a bunch of other companies, they're just like coming up. I get to talk to a bunch of tech people and they're just incredible. Versus San Francisco, there's a cynicism a bit. And also some of the interaction with strangers, there's always a bit of a calculation, like how good is this going to be for my career? Or how can, yeah. How can hanging out with this person can advance me? You go to a party, they're seizing up. It's like, I'm not gonna talk to so and so because that's not gonna advance me. Who's gonna advance me next? And so this is what I would not wanna see here in Austin. And I think maybe there's one way to try to, I really would like to see Austin not go the way San Francisco did and other towns before. I like how you pronounce San Francisco with a French accent. San Francisco? Yeah, that's great. That's the one word you go with a French accent. You have to. It sounds beautiful. San Francisco. San Francisco. But you know, so now that you find that cute, you're gonna have to forgive me when I mess up my English because English is not my first language. So I always try to make sure people know that. But you know Lex, this is why I am very interested in what some folks here are working on. And I'm just gonna be very selfish here because I wanna help her with what she's doing. It's someone like, you know, Nicole Nodzak and her project, you know, with the housing project that they have right now, making sure that Austin remains a town that's affordable for people of all walks of lives. If we can accomplish making sure that all walks of lives, doesn't matter how little or big you're making money wise, that you can stay in this town so the diversity at that level can remain, then I think Austin stands a chance to really show the world how to do things differently. And what I love about, you know, her initiative is just how they're really trying, you know, to again work on keeping affordability down for most people. I think it's important to, because it seems like it matters to you, I know that it matters to me. I absolutely would not wanna see Austin go away that San Francisco did. And I think the key to that is making sure that true diversity, not like the fluff, fluff crap diversity we're hearing over there. And that's another thing by the way, because San Francisco likes to pride itself in, oh, you know, we are so into diversity, but I'm like, if diversity for you means gender, difference of gender, skin color, you know, maybe the different accents we have, and you think check, check, check, check, check, I'm like, it's not enough. Can we also add diversity of thoughts? And that's the other problem I have with that place, you know? And I know some folks who are scared of saying much around people, that's also another thing. So not only they're sizing you up, but everybody's also, there is this invisible, this invisible, how should I say this? There's this invisible agreement that they all seem to have to stay on script. Yeah, there's a feeling like you're following a certain kind of script that's very kind of shallow. And there is a bit of a categorization going on, which category do you belong to? And let's put this into a simple math equation, what comes out, as opposed to just the free, open embrace of people, the weirdos, the characters, the interesting, the full, deep sense of diversity. Not just ideas, but backgrounds, and rich and poor. Artists, engineers. High school dropouts, PhDs, all of this. Yes, yes, that's what makes for a rich society if it's gonna get ahead. I'm glad you mentioned Nicole's efforts, I know she really is passionate about. I don't know how complicated that work is, because there's probably a big force trying to increase how much it costs to live in Austin. I don't know how you resist that. Whenever I go to New York City, just the fact that there's a giant park in the middle of it, I wonder, how did they pull this off? This is amazing. It's like to resist the force of the increasing price of the land, and still to protect this idea of having a park. And then in the same way, protecting the ability for people from all walks of life to live in the center of the city, to live around the city, to chase a dream when they don't get any money in their pocket. Absolutely. I don't know how you do that. It's partly political, probably, regulation, all that kind of stuff. A lot of it has to do with regulations. And this is where her and I also very much see eye to eye in terms of the free markets and also prosperity building, because it's always the same problems most of the time, most places. Here, what you have is some people in the name of, we gotta stand for, and I don't like to use this word, but maybe you help me find a better one, but at least that's a word that people can understand. We gotta stand for the lesser fortunate among us. Some people would call them, maybe oftentimes use the word, maybe the underdogs, whatever it is. I will just say maybe the lesser fortunate among us, right? In the name of standing up for them, you're promoting policies that are actually gonna backfire and where they end up being the first ones to suffer from it. So let's take this whole housing issue that Nicole and her team are working on. We find that oftentimes the cost at the end of the day, it's the good old supply and demand equation. If you're gonna make it so hard that the supply level of housing remains below a certain threshold, remains lower than the demand of people who need, especially affordable housing, housing altogether, what's gonna happen is scarcity, prices go up, and who gets kicked out first? The lesser fortunate among us. And so, but I find that oftentimes people in the name of We Care don't engage their mind. And a friend of mine said this, and he said it so well. He said, having a heart for the poor, that's easy. Having a mind for the poor, that's the challenge. And oftentimes we all have a heart for the poor. But when it comes then to, then what do we do to have a real impact on making sure that people get a chance at going up, then that's where everything starts falling apart. And then you have people who, then they start pushing for policies, housing policies, making it super hard for you to even renovate or add one more store to your home or anything like that. By doing that, you're messing up with the supply, with the supply of housing. And therefore the people who can't afford, people get priced out of the market. And so what people like Nicole are doing are going back to where all of this is taking place and they're going back to the regulation side. And just like, I'm sure we'll talk about it here, but people wonder today, why is Africa the poorest region in the world? We go back to the same culprit. Bad laws and tons of senseless regulations. If you make it so hard that in Berkeley, for someone to build one more store to their home, which means maybe one more unit that could be rented out to someone. And if many more people do that, then you have a much bigger supply, which means the prices will go down, which means more people have access and among them, especially the lesser fortunate among us, then we're starting to see a winning proposal, aren't we? But instead, if you go the other way around, then all of a sudden you're pricing them out of the market. Same thing was done with us. So oftentimes when I see problems of this nature, you can betcha that regulations and census laws are the heart of it. And that's what they're tackling. It's not popular, it's not fun. And people tend to not even understand where you're coming from. But this is a problem we have with people not understanding economic econ 101. Well, so it's the regulation and the laws and the system that props them up and increases the span of those laws. And we'll talk about that, the fascinating way those kinds of things develop when it works, when it doesn't. Let me sort of step back and ask you a question about Africa. In the West, in many places in the world, Africa is almost talked about like it's one country, like it's one place. So in what ways is Africa one community? And in what ways is it many, many, many communities? Just from your perspective from in Senegal and beyond. Right. So at the most basic of what makes us one goes back to even what makes you African. You are African, I'm African. We're one big family. Africa is very much at the end of the day, the foundation and the birth of the human race. So from that standpoint, at the most basic level, we're all Africans. Where this whole thing started. Exactly, exactly. Where this whole thing started and how at some point humanity was hanging by its fingernails. Only 2000 of us were left on this earth. And eventually we started, we went for survival. And that's how we started to spread around and some going up north, some going this way, that way. And as you're traveling to different places then features start to change to adapt to where you are, right? So hair gets lighter for some people, eyes get different shape for others to adjust to our new natural habitat. You know, the genomics program, I think at the National Geographic did that so well for people who are interested in going back to that work with Spencer Wells and such. But yeah, so at the very basic, most basic level, that's what unites us all first of all. And then I would say that the continent, especially here I will group it into black Africa, you know, black Africa. Unfortunately our common stories, you know, of having gone through this terrible, horrible period of around the same time the whole continent being, you know, enslaved and colonized. So that in a way forms, not that we were ever the first people or only people ever, you know, enslaved in this world. As a matter of fact, I mean, the word slaves comes from esclav, you know, esclav, slave, slavs, les slavs, right, from the Eastern block. So the first slaves were actually people looking more like you than looking like me, right? So, but we don't necessarily remember all of that because in our human psyche, the closest to us in history of a big mass of people being enslaved is African people. We were the last, you know, group like that. You know, the pain of World War I and World War II permeates Europe, but it certainly does for the former Soviet Union, the countries that made up the former Soviet Union. Does in the same way, the pain of slavery and empires using Africa, does that permeate the culture? Is there still echoes of that? In a way, yes, especially the fact that, you know, in many different places, whether it's Ghana or my country or Benin, where you have these places that we call the door of no return or the places of no return, which this was the last place where the slaves were standing or, you know, this is in Senegal, we call it the door of no return. There is this one door, you're there in the slave house. And once they go, they go, that's it. That's gonna be the last time they see back home. So, you know, those, of course, of course, it creates for a common lived experience, which becomes a common lived history. And of course, it's gonna tire us up. Is there a resentment, because you mentioned hospitality, is there a kind of a resentment of the foreigner that there's a rich, vibrant land? There's many resources, there's powerful cultures. Are they just going to show up and use us? That's a way to see geopolitics in this modern world. This is, okay, so where it plays very differently is, so if you came to Senegal today, there is not really a problem at that level. Where people's resentment start to come from is, of course, when bad behavior shows up, meaning like you have so many white people who can show up and just in the attitude, they have an entitlement attitude, right? And they think that in a way, we're all still servants. Some people in your face, some people more, but that can cause some little resentment, but where really the resentment is. And that can, the entitlement can take different forms, like even pity. Yes, don't even get me going on that one. I was trying to be polite today. So just don't, Lex, do not. You know, sometimes I tell myself, my God, today you're going to be all composed. You know, Lex is all composed. So don't go there and make a fool of yourself. Just behave. But if you get me on some grounds, that's when it's all going to go to hell. So yeah, let's move beyond that too. So resentment, there's a dance between hospitality and resentment. And resentment. So when you come in, you're you, you live your life. You're just a normal human being and you treat me decently like you would treat a friend, normal people. I have no problem with you. I'm not going to come back and be like, well, you and your ancestors have enslaved me. You, you're not going to see that stuff. Sometimes I'm in this country where I feel like that's, you know, it might look like that, but we in Africa don't do that. Now, if you come, you have this nasty attitude. You think you're still serving servants around. Well, you can have a problem with someone like me. I might even grab you by the back of your neck and, you know, take you back to the airport. That's when you're lucky. I'll be you very quickly. Exactly. and all those skincare products. Some ingredients I'm able to find in the country at the standard that I need in order to remain competitive. Because for example, our products are sold at Whole Foods Market. You can understand it's a pretty sophisticated and really, they don't just put anybody on the shelves. But the thing is, it means that on the other end, my inputs has to be right. So out of those, some, we have seven ingredients, seven items that need to come from abroad to go into the making of this product. Some packaging and some raw material. But guess what, Lex, for five of them, I am paying a 40% tariff and for the other two, almost 70% tariff. That I call senseless laws. These tariffs are senseless. Yeah, corruption is just a symptom. They reveal that something was broken about the laws. And the laws are, so taxation, this kind of restricting laws, like laws that slow down the entrepreneurial momentum. They do, they do. Because in this case, when my product comes, what do people have to do? Because every time, if you add 40%, you're basically on the other end. So every time you add, if let's say my product normally costs a dollar and with your 40%, by the time I'm done, I had to pay, now it's costing me 140. By the time it arrives in my warehouse, in my manufacturing facility, it's now at 140 because of a tariff I left behind. That 40% you added to it, do you know how much it's gonna add to my final cost that once the product is finished, I have to sell it to the customer? I have to sell it for $1.60 more because of that 40 cents extra you took from me. In order for me at the end of the day to have some type of profits, because profits at the end of the day is the blood of a business. There are two people are misguided. They say, oh, you dirty, greedy business people. And it's all about profit, profit, profit, profit. You know, I belong to this organization called, I'm a board member on the conscious capitalism. It is the largest organization of purpose driven businesses and entrepreneurs. The type of people I told you about, we've started our businesses because we see something that needs to be taken care of in society. Whole Foods Market is one of them. The Container Store, you know, all of these companies that are beloved in the US that you can hear of. We believe that the end goal of business is purpose. But in order to do purpose, you have to have profits to stay alive. And the best way for people to think of profits so that they're not all twisted about it. Lex, if I asked you, what's your goal in the world? You're probably gonna tell me your dream. You're gonna talk to me about what you're doing right now and how you want to be uniting, or you want a more harmonious world. You want human flourishing. That's what you're working towards. That's what you say to me. You're not gonna say, well, my biggest goal in the world is to produce as many red blood cells as I can. Except you need to produce those, otherwise no Lex. And if no Lex, no one working. Yeah. You know what I mean? Yeah. So that's how people need to stop with this whole profit, non profit. Do we have some psychopaths among us? Yeah, one person of us in this world are psychopaths in every field, anywhere you look. And surely you'll find that in the entrepreneurial field. Entrepreneurs world as well. Yeah. So we have one person of us who are psychopath for sure. But do they define the rest of us? Absolutely not. And thankfully not. So let's just be clear on that. So here, you know, you charge me 40% tariff, which is outrageous. Then you're forcing me to sell it for $1.60 more than my competitor who does not have to go through that nonsense because she's an American woman who is operating in America. And she doesn't have that nonsense put on her. So now I'm on this market competing against this woman eye to eye. So if we're selling the same value product, mine costs $1.60 more simply because of some stupid rules from back home, then guess who is going to stay in business and who doesn't? See, they want to talk about equality. That's the type of equality I want to see. The playing field has to be leveled. Told you English is my fourth language. It was two people talking between us. Maybe we'll have this English thing figured out. We'll have it figured out. So the idea of capitalism, the idea of conscious capitalism is the thing that in large part enables this level playing field. That's what we want. So what you're trying to say, so here, so when I talked about census laws, that's an example. So when you make the tariff so high that you're going to render me, you know, noncompetitive, then that's where, for people who might make sense, when the product arrives at port, they say, hey, I give you this. What I give you, maybe it's 10% of the price or 5%. It's surely not 40%, but you are happy with it. You're the government official. That's what we call a bribe. And me, I'm like, hey, I saved myself money. And also I saved myself time. But you see, if the laws where you pay 5% or even the 10% that I just left behind or nothing, you come, you pay it, you move on. Because who has a business of fooling around and staying behind? And no, you do that when it's actually makes sense to do that. So I'm not sitting here telling people I engage in unlawful practices in my case, because I'm around saying the things I'm saying right now. So I'm a target. You have to do things cleanly. And I believe in doing things that way. So what I had to do was go to the ask again mayor. We have a problem. Mayors, whenever he sees me, he's like, now what? So I'm like, we've got a problem. You're best friends now. So I say, now it's the customs. And he's like, what do you want me to do? I said, do you know anybody at customs? I need to hire up at customs, because I got to explain to them what's going on here. They all know, of course, but I think they're not always maybe understanding or maybe they understand. And in this case, he understood. So we went and he's like, yeah, I know this is not, this is not very, yeah, this. And I said, what do we do now? And I saw him going through binders and binders in his office, because he's going to try to go and look where in the law can we find something that can help me escape these rules. And you know, the best he found Lex was, oh, well here, see this one. If you've been in business for two years, then we can allow you, there's a special term for it. It's French, it's technical. We can allow you to bring your raw material, but you have to tell us exactly how much you're bringing. And it has to match your formulation because, you know, they don't want you to bring in more that we need and maybe sell some of that to the rest of the market and they didn't make their money on it. So there, it means I have to give them my recipe. Imagine Coca Cola being asked to give their secret sauce to government officials in a country that you can't even know what might happen, let alone even in business, you don't do that. I mean, trade secrets are trade secrets, but here you're asked to be putting it in front of some people you don't know where it's going to go after that. Because there they get to see, okay, her recipe calls for X amount of Candelilla Wax, X amount of coconut oil. Okay, and on top of that, we have to think about how much foliage might there be or not because again, we don't want her to buffer it over there. So you have to get naked in front of them in terms of your recipe, which might end up only God knows where tomorrow, maybe competition or maybe even them, they start a business and they compete with you because we've seen that. So you have to do that. And then each time fill out a paperwork, get the approval, then it can come in. So when it can come in, you don't have to pay the tax. Oh, and by the way, you have one year, one year to make this product and get it out. And all of it needs to be back out because if any of it stays here, you're going to pay the taxes that we held up. So you're basically forced by these census laws to be dishonest if you want to succeed. All of this is so cumbersome because it means more paperwork, paperwork everywhere, maybe having to disclose your things. So me, in my case, what I did is this person said, okay, we're going to see how we can work with you. But for the first two years, we were more or less in the gray area. Yeah, so even gray area is good. Yeah, but what does it mean? In a situation like that, whenever they want to mess with you, it means they can come and they will look and they will find something. So it means that every day I'm trying to do business, I'm running the risk of being harassed and or maybe even put in jail, depending on what it is. I mean, you're an incredible person because it seems like there's two ways to change this. One is to become president or gain power in the country and to try to change the laws, which seems really difficult to do. And the other way is fight through the laws and create the business anyway, build the business community and through that method, create a huge amount of pressure to change the laws. You're totally getting it with your last part because this is the other thing. And this is where I get so upset sometimes with my fellow Africans because they get so disgusted by what they're seeing, right? And they think the answer is to go for politics. Let's go be president. Let's go be this. Let's go be that. And we're gonna change everything. I see that in the US too. People thinking that presidents have all this power. Do you know who has the least power in government? The president. I mean, people don't get that. Your best bet, if you insist on going into politics, stick to the local level. That's where all the skeletons are buried and hidden. And that's where you can make the most impact, local level. I know it's not shiny. I know it's not exciting, but that's where it's at. So if you must go into politics, but there's another way. So in my case, what I do is two things. I preach and I practice. I preach, when I'm here talking to you about this, I'm preaching. I am sharing with people that is which I found. And by the way, the answer was there. I was doing these two businesses, realizing the difference in treatment of the doing business environment of the US compared to the doing business environment of Senegal. And at first I was like, of course, us, everything is messed up. It's because we're a poor country. But when I started to put two and two together, I'm like, you're poor because you have no money, at least not enough money to take care of your basic needs. You have no money because you have no source of income. Where does a source of income come from for most of us? It comes from a job, doesn't it? And then some people, sometimes at my UC Berkeley class, they say, oh no, it comes from government too. I'm like, I would like to think that even if you work for government, you're going to be paid something, right? And they're like, yeah. And then even before I can say something, they're like, yeah, because that money we use to pay our public officials comes from taxes, you know, employers, employees, we go back to the private sector for most of it, from where this whole thing is created. So it's clear, you're poor because you have no money, no money because no source of income, source of income for most of us is a job. We're talking about, so where do jobs come from? The private sector, primarily small and medium sized enterprises. Then don't you think that we should make it easy, that we should have a friendly doing business environment. And also a lot of it comes not just from the small and medium sized businesses, but I think a lot of the values created from new ones being launched, right? It's not just like me, like saving somehow through regulation, the ones that are already there. It's like letting the market, letting the new better ideas flourish. It's about what I mean by doing business environment is all the things that you and I talked about earlier. Even the access of electricity is part of a doing business, but doing business. So basically when I discovered all of that, when I put all of those dots together, then I'm like, well, I guess the business, and it makes sense, Lex. If you want to grow tomatoes, you're gonna have to have two things. One is a good seed, right, that has good attributes. And then you're gonna have to have a good environment for it. Is the soil the right one? What's your pH level? All of those good nutrients that you're gonna put in it. Is it in a place that has tons of sun? How much sun exposure or not? The climate in general, is it gonna be cold? Not, not. You can have some beautiful tomatoes in the middle of Siberia, last time I checked. So same thing here. You know, Mohammed Yunus, the Nobel Laureate for Peace, said, poor people are bonsai people. They're the same people. If you put them in the normal, natural, friendly habitat where they can thrive, they become the tallest tree in the forest. Poor people are bonsai people. So you see that tiny pot you put around the bonsai tree? That's the tiny pot that's created by giving me such a hostile business environment that basically we're put together by the set of laws that you have put, that basically I have to jump through as a business person, practicing business in my country. If you turn that environment into a friendly environment where I am not married to my employees, I have flexibility of the labor laws are simple, straightforward, clean, where the tax code is very simple. It's not worth truckloads of laws like in my country. It's so complicated. You have to hire a CPA, which costs more money. And even them tell them, girl, we're gonna make some mistakes. They don't talk to me like that. They don't tell me, girl, they shouldn't, they better not. But they say, whatever they say. They say. I'm scared. You know. You know, they're like, we're gonna, but bottom line is we're gonna make mistakes. This thing is so complicated, we're gonna make mistakes. So, which means my ass is on the line. So anyway, so if the tax code was so simple, straightforward, like it is maybe in Texas, where up till a threshold, you owe me nothing, go online, five minutes, fill out your taxes, you're compliant, keep building your business because that's what we need from you. If you made it so easy and straightforward, then you know what? That's when you get all of these people, Lex, that you're talking about saying, you know what? My name is Aminata, and I live in the middle of nowhere, Senegal. But you know what? I've got this great idea for this really hot, nice hot sauce that I know the Americans are gonna love. I'm hearing that hot sauce is a big thing. Let me bring it to them. But everything is there for you to jump into the ring of entrepreneurship. You don't have to know someone like my God. You don't have to even have the ability to sell yourself maybe like I can sometimes. You are someone with a great idea. You're willing to work hard for it and pour everything you got into it. Guess what? It's there. You can get into the race. You can be a dreamer, and you can be a dreamer in a rural little village. And then that has ripple effects throughout the entire country. Young kids growing up, you know, I wanna be the next X, whatever. And it doesn't have to be the next Steve Jobs. That seems really far, far away. It's at all levels. You create local heroes because representation matters. Right? So, and we are so badly in need of that. And so that's what all the things that have been stolen from us as long as things remain the same. So Lex, once I found out that basically at the end of the day the answer is economic freedom. And that when it comes to that, the indexes, economic indexes that measure that, whether it's the doing business index ranking of the World Bank, or the Fraser Economic Freedom Index of the Heritage Foundation. When you look at all of those indexes and others, what do they have in common? One after another they show you that it is harder to do business in almost anywhere in Sub Saharan Africa than it is per se anywhere in Scandinavia. So it is telling you that Scandinavian nations, that socialist Americans tend to love so much and take as an example, although there too they're showing you that they don't understand what's going on really in Scandinavia, that Scandinavia is more capitalist. Scandinavian nations are more capitalist than almost any Sub Saharan African nations. Ultimately, the political systems actually don't even matter nearly as much as the private sector being able to operate the machinery of capitalism. There you go, there you go, there you go. And it's almost like, like I said, it's almost like its own little widget within it. You can have whatever type of society you want to practice, you want to exercise at whatever level you want to. But if you're serious about becoming a capitalist, becoming a middle to high income nation, there is no other pathway that we know of at this point. And you know what made me super excited about that beyond having finally found my answer. I have to tell you when I found that answer, I literally fell to my knees. It was the type of feeling that, you know, if something is not well with you, whether it's physical or mental, something is not well, you're not well. And you go around and you go to the so called specialists, some of them, you know, but you're going around for years, going around trying to get help for your ailment. And here they don't know. Here they tell you things that you can't tell why, but you just know it's not true. They're this, they're that. And it's going on for years after year after year. And finally you meet this one person and boom, it's there. Not only the liberation, but also this whole new world that comes with it. You know, I'm still ill, but guess what? There's a path forward. We know that. I'm going to have a lot of work to do, but there's hope. Yeah, and you're the beacon of hope actually, for a lot of people in that part of the world. And those beacons are actually really necessary. So not only is there hope, but you can become, I mean, the beacon for your people, your home, this power that you see that you feel all around to become, to escape the feeling of being trapped. Is there a device you can give to people that, to young girls and boys dreaming somewhere in Africa of how to change the world? That's right. And by the way, I want to say there are bigger beacons. There are better beacons than me. I just happen to be someone who has the chance of talking to you right now. And one of my goals is to open the same doors that were opened for me, because together, our voice, there's such amazing stories out there. And so bigger beacons, better beacons out there. One thing here for me, the reason why I do what I'm doing right now, and it's almost to a point of self destructing my own health. I feel invested with such the mission of, I have been afforded the truth. So it is my moral duty to try to take it around. I know I sound, people sometimes say, when I listen to you, I feel like I'm talking to a priest. And I'm like, because the gospel, I receive the gospel. So anyway, but the thing is, Lex, who tells you these things to this day? When they talk about the poverty of Africa, what do they talk about? They sit in front telling you, oh yeah, it's because of colonialism. It's because of racism. It's because of imperialism. It's because they're stealing raw material, blah, blah, blah. Is any of those guilty to some level of where we are today? Maybe part of the reason where we are today? Maybe, maybe. Is that the only reason or the overwhelming reasons? No. Is that insurmountable? Absolutely not. So for me, don't stay in that place that steals and robs you of your agency. So I think it's important for people to A, get the right diagnosis as to why we are where we are. Because what you and I just talked about, the mainstream does not talk about this when they even talk about Africa in terms that are not the usual suspect of, oh, famine is building over there. War is building over here. Oh, we're having Ebola is coming. All of that stuff. Even when they were talking about the monkeypox, which at first, in this wave, it started with white people in Europe. Well, even in the many newspapers you pull out, it's black people with monkeypox on their skin. I'm like, wait a second. This time around, it did not start with us. So why are you always showing us when it's right now happening to white people? So all of that is happening. So for me, the thing is, we, the world simply right now, does not have the right diagnosis as to why this continent right now, despite all of its riches, because Lord knows it's got riches starting it with its young population. 75% of the population in my country is below the age of 25 years old. So when we're talking, I know we're talking about, repopulation, it's an important, we're gonna have to go for that. Maybe you'll get me going about comments, I don't know, but anyway. So here, my point is, A, we need the right diagnosis as to why this continent is the poorest continent in the world, despite its riches starting with its young people, all the natural resources, diversity in land, people, cultures, languages, everything that make for great ingredient for awesomeness. Despite all of that, we are the poorest region in the world. People need to know that the reason why that is, it's because we also happen to be the most overregulated region in the world. At the end of the day, what Africa, and I dare to say Africa here, and treated as one, we are 54 countries, 55 depending on how you count, yet we almost for a tiny minority of these countries, we almost all lack one of the most crucial freedoms that there are. If you're serious about prosperity building, we lack economic freedom. And economic freedom is the thing that unlocks that human potential of the young people just. Yes, for them to run, to run with their ideas, to start businesses, or to start initiative. It doesn't have to be for profit all the time, right? But it is this thing that gets you to get up and go and do something, criticize by creating. Young people are naturally wired to wanna criticize by creating. They're not sitting around waiting or complaining usually, unless you put them in a tiny box and they have no other way to go. And in this situation, what they do, let's talk about precolonial Africa, of four favors before slavery ever happened. There were black people on the continent. You see, when we talk about the story of black people and Africans, black people in Africa, for most of us, even me, I noticed that unconsciously it starts with slavery. But you're like, no, we were there before, before white men ever set foot. Who were we? What were we doing in our diversity? What economic systems were we running on? And then you realize that for most of them, they were free marketeers and they were very much on the free trade, on the free enterprise side. So even that is a reinforcement. This is a place where we do not understand our history. So proper diagnosis, Africa is a poorest region in the world because it happens to be the most overregulated region in the world, lacks economic freedom. Number two, what do we do about that? We gotta become serious about reforms, economic reforms, so that we can become beacons of free markets. Just like the Asian tigers, that's what the Asian tigers did. They had to become serious. Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea, those guys had to become serious about the free markets. Lee Kuan Woo, he's just like, we gotta do something. And he looked around and he realized at some point, we gotta make these reforms. And he went onto that journey of reforms, making his country one of the most free market countries in the world, and voila, the magic happened. Back in the 30s, the stock market crash and the Great Depression and everything, the world and with all the lies that were told to the world coming from the Soviet Union, Stalin, while they were starving and dying over there, but oh no, I mean, Durante was telling the world that, oh no, no, everything is going well, nobody's dying when we know now and getting political prices based on this stuff. But then the world went on believing that, oh no, capitalism failed. This crash that you had in the stock market is proof this is what late stage capitalism produces. You guys always have your big ups and downs. And by that time, it was so hard on people that they're like, we're done with this. And at the same time, we were told the lies coming out of the Soviet Union, that supposedly the communism was doing just fine. And you're at the point where the free market concept almost died and it's the Asian tigers who kind of helped bring that idea back to life, right? Their success having used the free markets. And so for me, we gotta make a new commitment to the free markets on this continent if we wanna go anywhere, if we wanna go anywhere. And the timing is perfect because the young people, there is a kind of freedom for the revolutionary free markets in this whole space. Exactly, and you said something, oh, say that again, because I wanna tell you what I'm hearing in that, because something's really cool. Say it again, come on, Lex. I don't know which part, English is my second language too. No, you said there's something revolutionary in that. Because you know how young people are attached to the revolution and how, I understand, look Lex, I understand and I am willing to give the benefits of a doubt to some of these socialists who came to it because they had to witness some of the horrors of their times. There's a revolutionary spirit behind that. It's ultimately criticized by creating. Exactly, exactly, but violent revolution is never the answer. But that's what they went for in 1789 in France, the French Revolution, and Marx and Engels, they're promoting these ideas that usually, for them, justifies violent revolution. Then in all of these people, I am with them when they say that they want to see equal rights for people. Of course, I don't agree with their, therefore, we need to push for equal outcomes. Equal rights is right, but equal outcomes is not right. But I am with them for all the way to equal rights, but this is where the two paths go this way. And also, the fact that they have no issue with violent revolution, people get killed. People get put in gulags and people get, that's not right. So what you just said here, just give me goosebumps, because there is revolution in the free markets, but that's the type of revolution we want. The revolution that comes from people creating, criticizing by creating, it's one of the best forms of revolution. If you ask me, that's the most sexy way of revolution. Criticize by creating, but what, you're gonna go shoot people or be like, what's his name, Che Guevara, who tells you, I love, it's in writing, I love nothing more than to fry the brain of a man with his gun, really? Well, in terms of sexy, there is power in that message of the oppressor, the abuser, the enemy that has abused their power, they need to be destroyed, and there's power in the message of that violence. Unfortunately, the lessons of history show that the violence, one, doesn't work, but it does the following. There is something about human nature, as the old cliche goes, that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely, is the people who are in charge of committing that violence it does something to their head. The first person you kill, the second person you kill, for some reason, you lose your ability, the compassion for other humans. Even if you began as a revolutionary, as the Soviets did, fighting for the worker, for the rights and the basic humanity of the people that really do the work, you lose the plot somehow because of the violence. So in that way, it seems like the lesson, at least of this part of the human history, until the robots take over, is that the economic freedom, free markets, and protecting those, and allowing anyone from your country to dream and to make that dream a reality by creating it with as few sort of roadblocks as possible. Exactly, so that's why for me, the message is very clear, is what we talked about today. The reason why Africa is the poorest region in the world is because it happens to be the most overregulated region in the world, and for some people who might be put off by it because they're like, oh, she's talking about laissez faire! No, let me put it maybe in a way that you can understand. Do you think that it should be as easy for any person in Africa, for any entrepreneur in Africa to enterprise than it is for any person in Scandinavia to enterprise? If your answer is yes, which I would hope it is, then you have a moral obligation to work with me to make my country, and as a whole, my continent, more free markets. It's that simple. At that point, there's no like, yes, but on the other hand, uh uh, no. And for me, on that question, and I yet have to find somebody who claims to say no. If you say no, then we have a whole nother problem that I'm not even talking to at that point anymore. So yeah. So just to clarify, there's a perception in some reality that the Scandinavian countries have elements of socialism in their politics, in their society, even in their economics. So at the very least, Africa should have, in terms of economic indices, should be as free as the Scandinavian countries. You're just giving that example. As economically free, yes. Because see, the Scandinavian, they do have a subsidized, you know, like a welfare system, that's what, a more socialized welfare system, but the way they make their money is very much the way of the free markets. So there is how you make your money, and then there's how you maybe decide as a country to redistribute it, right? And so even there, even in Scandinavia, again, yes, they have more economic freedom. So then from there, Lex, where we go is my job and my goal is for every single African, young and old, to know what I have come to learn. We are not doomed. It's not over for us. We will never catch up. The time for catch up is gone, but guess what? We've got a strong, strong possibility and chance to leapfrog, and leapfrog we will. It is still time, but for that to happen, like I said, we need to know what we just talked about today because that is not what the mainstream keeps us abreast with. When you go to the World Bank, they don't necessarily work along these lines. They're still, it's not, when you go to universities, I will ask you, MIT, the MIT Econ Department, or even some, most of the professors, are they free market oriented? We find that oftentimes in academia, there is a strong anti capitalist bias. There is a strong anti free market bias. So this is a problem. This is a problem. Nobody cares about the economists anyway. Yeah, so we move forward. In MIT, the spirit of the entrepreneur burns bright, not in the economics department because they just write op ed articles, but in the dreamers, the young undergrads that actually build something. No, I get that. But then we cannot be stifling their efforts by putting these artificially made regulations and laws that stand in the way and clip their wings. So that's why when you were saying, what advice do you give to them? The advice I give to them is each one of them, they have to pay attention to this discourse we just had. I don't ask anybody to agree with me on face value. Go back, do like I had to do. I come very much from the left of the left, if you can believe that. But I had to have my own intellectual journey. And in this case, my intellectual journey was very much complimented by my own life. Having to build these companies on two separate continents and having to, I had front row seat of the differences. At first, I thought it was this way just because we're poor and therefore we must stop and therefore it's like this. But eventually I learned that no, we're poor because we lack academic freedom. And if a country allows its citizens the academic freedom to enterprise, then they become rich. So yeah, I had it upside down, you see. And so it's important for people to know that. So number one, know your facts because your facts will empower you. In this case, I like to use that word, facts will empower you and they will even furthermore, they will power you, empower and power you. Because empower is like inside and power is like I push you forward and up. So that's what it does to know the facts. And then go on and look around you. Where are the best practices of this? Who is at the cutting edge of a free markets? Where it's done in a way there, people don't necessarily be left behind or anything like that. We're in 2022 for Christ's sake. We don't have to do entrepreneurship the same way maybe it was done 50 years ago, 100 years ago when as a community, as a people, we were maybe less enlightened because of our times, right? We can update this thing and move forward, but update is definitely not build back, what do they call it? Build back new or whatever they're calling it at the WF, whatever nonsense and stuff they're smoking over there. It's not that. There are some principles that are universal and that stand the test of time. Those we have to keep and on top add the new things we learned from our times and from life. So that's what I want them to know. Learn your facts, be empowered and powered, and then look around, think about it and look to see where the best practices are around the world because the world is yours. You might be African, but the world is yours. So stop this nonsense of, oh, well, it's done by white people, so we're not gonna do it. Get the best that exists in humanity for what you're trying to solve. And on top of that, put your own twist, right? Bitcoin is all of ours to take. Bitcoin is not the white man's thing, so therefore, oh, come on, you know, because we have a misguided pride, we're not gonna use Bitcoin because it's white man's time. Bitcoin is math, you idiot. Math is universal, so it belongs to all of us. There's no color. Exactly. In the space of economics, in the space of ideas. And there's a chance to leapfrog too, which is really, really powerful. Exactly, because here we will leapfrog, and let's, I'm not crazy, this is gonna happen. You mark my words, but it's gonna happen if as many people hear what we're talking about today, because at some point, the solution is not gonna come. It's not me, it's not, it's gonna come from the wisdom of a crowd. This is why I love the crowd. There's no better wisdom than the crowd, and that's also why I believe in the free markets. This concept of emergent order, there's no way, there's no central planning that is smart enough, that has the level of intel that street level people have, trying to create something. It's just, we just have to be humble. There's just something at the bottom of a pyramid that just bubbles up and happens. They're the best. I think the cynicism, the idea that people are dumb is at the core of a lot of things that prevent the flourishing of society. You know, this kind of anecdotally, people are like, ah, everyone is stupid, and people say that jokingly. But the reality is, people are incredible. They have the capacity for kindness, for love, for innovation, for brilliance, in all kinds of dimensions. You might suck at math, but you might be amazing at carpentry. You have to find that thing, and there's something about, when there's a freedom to find that thing, and people interact, they get excited about shit together, and then they build. If you look at authoritarian, at places that limit that freedom, at the core, I think, is the idea that people are dumb. Let us take care of everything. We'll come up with the rules and the regulations, because people are too dumb to manage things themselves. And then that idea builds on top of itself, where you think that the entire populace is much lesser than the wise sages sitting at the top. Then you add violence on top of that, and that leads to corruption, to corrupting of just the human mind of the leaders, and the whole thing becomes a giant mess. The antidote to that is economic freedom. For people to have a freedom to enterprise. And look, Lex, when we allow for that to happen, have you looked around lately and looked at the level of niche that has happened in this country? I mean, you have clubs where, you have places where people are into guitar strings, you know, like some of the, like it's all about guitar strings. And others, it's all about these best cupcakes. And others, it's all about this new crypto thing over here. And others, like hair, best, you know, weight. It's, when you allow us, because seven billion geniuses, each one of us, I believe, came to this world with something, something that only he or her possesses. And that is the genius, and it is their contribution to the human problem. When you think about your identity today, so it all started in Africa, just like it did for the entirety of the human species. There's a bit of European flavor in there, a little French, Silicon Valley. You're now, in part, a Texan. There's, you really are an American, but you're also an African. Who are you, when you look in the mirror, when you think about yourself, when you listen, when everything gets quiet and you listen to your heart, who are you? Can you figure out that puzzle? That's a very interesting question, because it's been a long time I haven't asked myself. I have before. What I have found is, I think who I am today has been, for sure, shaped by, I call it Dakar, Paris, San Francisco. Dakar is Senegal, Paris, France, and San Francisco, primarily. And now, yeah, I think I might want to ask, there's a little bit of Texan in there. How do you say Texas in French? Texas. Texas. Texas. Yeah. Austin, Texas. Austin, Texas. Austin. Austin, Texas. It's easy. Not quite as good as San Francisco. Austin, Texas. Yeah, yeah. Us, Texas. Us. Texas, yeah. So, you, I was formed by those three. I have to say that what I enjoy from my Senegalese roots are our commitment to peace, love, and tolerance very much. And Taranga, obviously. And I like that it's a culture that's very much about reverence. It's, we're big on reverence. I don't think you could ever hear me tell an older person, especially not my parents or my grandma or anybody like that, for us to be able to tell an older person that's not true or you're lying would never cross my mind because that's the most disrespectful thing you can think of, the most irreverent thing you can think of. It doesn't mean that you have to agree with everything that's said, but there is a way to disagree. There is a way to push back that doesn't have to rob this person who happens to be older than you, especially from the dignity that older age normally provides. And there's wisdom to their words that you yourself may not see. So the reverence is for the idea of wisdom, of tradition. Exactly, exactly. And again, so that is something that I really enjoy, especially, and something I'm very attached to, to this day, and then from France, what I really came to enjoy, of course, is all the fineness that one can find within French culture. The fineness? Yeah, the fineness. Foods. You mean like the intricacies, like the very... Yeah, the soft sophistication in there. I mean, French lingerie, for example. I mean, la dentelle, the laces, all of that, it's super, it's exquisite. So the... The fashion, the food. The fashion, the food. I mean, there's something to be said about all of that, and it's very beautiful. And I love also, even when I talk about fineness, it's like a meal is not about this big thing they put in front of you, but smaller portions, enjoy what you're eating and spend time at a table. Like the eating time is not necessarily just this function of feeding yourself, which I understand it, but this is something that they share with Senegalese culture, is eating is a moment of communion. It's a moment of friendship, family. It's a precious moment. To this day, and my husband is American, we eat our meals together all the time. I would not have it any other way. And there's a prep time, all of that stuff. It doesn't matter how busy I am, but we're doing it. Actually, to push back a little bit, it's interesting, because yeah, the camaraderie over a meal is a beautiful thing. I got, I mean, I was in a pretty dark place because on the way to Ukraine, I traveled to Paris, I stayed in Paris, and I wasn't able to enjoy the fineness because it was almost a distraction from the humanity for some reason to me, because there's such a focus on the art of it all that you lose the basic connection to humanity. Now, that said. Depends what you're talking about. I think some of the lack of connection over humanity was the fact that while I did know how to speak French for a long time, I forgot most of the language. And so part of it, there is a barrier. You said hospitality. There is a bit of a barrier in French culture to where in order to be welcomed in, you have to hear the music and be able to play the music of the people. And if you don't, there's a bit of a barrier. I must admit on that end that it is true. You would feel less that if you were with a group of Senegalese people per se, or I would even say if a group of Spanish people. And I think this is maybe the other side of it for the French people. They can be a little bit uppity up there. And I think maybe that's what you're sensing there. If you don't have the codes, which is what you call if you don't sing the music, then it's hard for you to be part of it. But I was speaking here from the standpoint of your inn. Yeah, from the inside. Also, come on, coming from Texas and also Ukraine, Ukraine, I should say some of the best steak and meat I've ever had, cheap. Texas, some of the greatest. And the size of the meals in France, it's like, what are we doing here? I mean, I get it's art. I'd like to look at my art on the wall and then eat my damn steak. I just wanna cut the shit. Did you go, so maybe, okay, no, no, no, no. Okay, now here I have to defend them, although sometimes I'm the worst. Now, did you go to some Michelin star restaurant? Maybe that's why. Yeah, a little bit, a little bit. That's why, because next time you go to France, I'll take you to the countryside or any French home. They will serve you multiple times. I mean, by the time you're done, even if the portions are smaller, they're smaller if you want to, but because that way you get a chance to really feel what you're eating and then have more and then all of that stuff, but not be like, ah, like this. And then, but no, you'll eat plenty, but it's because you went to the Michelin places where they were like. I'm sure the warmth of the people is there. It almost makes me sad that sometimes, I think to properly be in a place, you really should spend a long time there. And also be emotionally ready. Again, I was emotionally unavailable. I was just like. Well, I would imagine on the way to the Ukraine, I'm like, who can think about food? But in your identity, a bit of Texas, a bit of San Francisco, a bit of Africa. Yeah, San Francisco. And I guess from the America, the defining thing for me for America is, it's the freedom and the entrepreneurial mindset. See, very quickly when I moved from France to the United States, and I started becoming successful in the United States, I found myself, me and my husband, he was French and my first husband who passed away. We found ourselves at some point, we stopped talking to our friends in France who stayed in France, because we were talking to them about things that were so outside of their comprehension. What do you mean you're in your twenties and you just raised, I don't know, a million dollars or $2 million, especially from back in those days. Today, it's easy here and there. So even in France, that entrepreneurial spirit didn't burn quite as bright. I mean, don't take me wrong. Do you have some entrepreneurial people in France? Yeah, but to the level that you have it in the US, absolutely not. It's just, I mean, in France, it's still very much, you're born in this area, you go to school in that area, your parents live around, eventually you'll marry and be where your parents are or maybe go to where your spouse's parents are and you buy your house and you buy it once and you're not gonna do like the Americans, two years later, I sell my house, I go somewhere else. You don't have any of anything. What do you mean, just stopping from nowhere, you're gonna do what? Start a business and you have nothing to back you up or whatever. Oh, and even this idea of going and fundraising, this venture cap, especially back in the days, venture cap, all of that, it's very American. We take it for granted, but it's very American. Who would have made a bet on me in France? The same person. I would not have found the same people. I would never in France have been able to raise, at some point it was $32 million for my first business, never would have been able to do that in France. And it doesn't mean that French people are bad people or anything like that. It's just something that's just not so in the culture. Just like this whole concept of philanthropy, it's not that the French people don't do philanthropy, but philanthropy in America is very different from the level and also the magnitude of maybe what the French people do. And also they have this always like, oh, let's do it behind the scene. Money is suspicious, success is suspicious. So at some point my husband and I just felt like our friends actually were maybe thinking that we're maybe some drug dealers or something. So we just stopped because it just was not flowing anymore. And so yes, in America I found this entrepreneurial spirit, but then I was able to link it with something that I'm very familiar with in my country. See, back home in Senegal, I'm part of this, you have what we call the Mourid, I'm a Mourid. So what it is is one of the four brotherhoods in Senegal, Mouridism is the most influential of them and the biggest one. And us, it's all about entrepreneurship as well. I mean, of course there's the whole religious part, but our mantra is, pray as if you will die tomorrow and work as if you will never die. And the way we say, the way somebody will say that somebody passed away, we say, somebody has retired. Somebody has retired from their work. Right? Beautiful. Right? So, I think it's funny because in that community, we're very much entrepreneurial, left to our own devices, we're entrepreneurial. But then what happens is the minute that we die, then what happens is the minute people start going to, they're being educated through the education system, you know, like the French, especially the system, but tend to breed more like, you know, the French bureaucrat mindset, then you can see all the entrepreneurial mindset kind of starting to dwindle down. So it's kind of very interesting. So in a way, America helped me reunite with that side of my roots, where America tells me, reinforces that side of my roots and also gives me more tools to practice that side of my roots, if that makes any sense. Through all of that, that's what brings out the heart of a cheetah, which I think is a beautiful, beautiful thing that encapsulates that whole trajectory, which I think is the best possible answer anyone could give. It makes me want to really think about who I am, because you really have brought together so many cultures within yourself that just talking to you makes you feel like we are just all one people. Because at the end we are, at the end we are. And, you know, when you come from, at the end we are, and also I think for me, if people can take anything from my story, it's at the end of the day, I am very clear about it. And I'm all for harmony among people and among us peoples. If we can accept that we're all, I know this sounds so cliche, but for me it's so true, that we're all humans. You know, when I left Senegal, when I was about to leave Senegal for the first time and to go to Europe to be reunited with my parents, because now they had emigrated and things were going to be fine. And I was going to be, things were stable for them. Now they're like, it's time to be reunited with her. They brought me over, but before I left Senegal, my grandma sat me down. She actually, she lowered herself down to my level and she said, my god, you're about to go to this place where most people will not look like you. And most people speak a language that's going to be different from yours. And you're going to realize that all the kids are going to school and you've never been to school because, you know, I was, like I said, a free range kid and I was just living my life. And she said, but I don't want for any of that, and she showed her words, she said, I don't want for any of that to intimidate you. She said, you can be impressed by some of it if you want, but no intimidation. And she said, because the fact that they might be different from you, yeah, they're going to have a different skin color from you, but it is still human skin. You're human, they're human. And she said, this language you're going to speak, it's a different language from yours, but it is still a language that humans speak. You're human, they're human. Therefore, you're going to speak it. And lastly, they have gone to school. Going to school is what little humans do. You're a little human, so you'll be just fine. And I went and grandma was right. Right, she was right. And that helped me. And I think when you internalize that so early on, it just makes you belong to the human family that you're part of. I am part of a human family. And I would have no problem going to Russia, for example, let's take, and be totally open. Maybe don't go right now, but. No, not now. Maybe not now, you're right. But what I just. Or at least don't bring weed if you go on the plane. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, yeah, right. That girl, I don't know what she was thinking, but. No, so, but what I'm trying to say, Lex, is I feel like I can go anywhere in the world, including some of the most unfriendly places in the world to someone like me, because there are places like that. And yet I know, I know that somehow, somewhere, someone will take care of me. Someone will help me. When I first came to this country, I came as a tourist, but you had this amazing family who had a business, a family business in Indiana, Columbus, Indiana, the Wences, Carolyn Eldon Wence, I owe them everything that I have in this country, that I am in this country. They are Americans in the mid America from a place that most other Americans would maybe look down on because, and some people would be like, oh, you're going to this place where they have more churches and cows than people, that type of behavior, because the elite coastal elites, but it is in Midwest, in the Midwest that I found, that I, black young women coming out of nowhere, found support. They all rallied around me. I didn't even come from the same faith as they are from, yet their whole church rallied around me to find me an apartment. My host family found me, got me a job, and it was not a pity job. They were like, we need, we are in serious needs of getting our accounting under control and our marketing and all of that. And I had to catch up years of accounting like to the cent and come up with marketing, all of that. And I did it way faster than they thought I would ever be able to do that. At some point they look at me and they're like, look, there is a future for you. And we are too small for that future. And now we could be selfish and keep you here with us. And we would want nothing more than that because really they're like my parents to this day. I just came back from seeing them. And they said, but there's so much more for you and we don't have it. So we want you to go and find out what it is. And that's eventually when I, because something was brewing up in San Francisco when I say I left my heart in San Francisco because the man who would become my husband, we went to the same business school in France, but then he was older than me. So he had come to San Francisco and started a business there. And it just looked like there was something there. And Scarola was like, you gotta go to San Francisco and find out with Emmanuel what's going on. So I went and I left my heart in San Francisco. I came back and I'm like, okay, I'm leaving. Here's the keys to my apartment. What, I don't understand. But I'm like, I'm out of here. So no, but Carol, so this is it. This is what I'm saying, especially in these times when this country loves to dwell on, you're bad because you have this skin color. Here are people with a completely different skin color than mine, completely different faith than mine, yet embraced me, protected me, paid for my visa, you know, for my lawyer, for my H1B, everything, and also played emotional support for me. And no one, no one asked them to do that. They didn't have to do it. They didn't. So what I'm saying is, and this has been the story of my life, everywhere I go, regardless of the hostility around me, you betcha that there's always, always gonna be somebody who shows up for you. And somebody who's at the extremes, at the antipodes of where you are and who you are. And that tells me something. In the end, we are good people. Most people are good people. And there's so much power to that, the internalizing of this idea that we're all just human and there's human kindness all around us. I've seen it a lot where people internalize that and they're able to walk lightly amidst hate and walk past it and it doesn't stick to them in a way that they build resentment and it paralyzes them. If they internalize the world as human, they can be in the, just like you said, in the worst places in the world for them. And someone, somewhere that human magic and touch is there. Yeah, it will find them. It will find, yeah, yeah. And you know, the other thing too, Lex is, especially in these times we're walking in, it is to remind yourself, I think this is where we all are called to practice more courage. But where things come up is, especially nowadays with the African youth, when we have to be reminded of the World Bank, when we have to be reminded of even the world, places like the World Economic Forum, you know, like all of these places that seem to constitute, they would, the way they describe them, when I say they, it's primarily my Pan African friends. So here maybe terms are worth describing. So the Pan African movement goes way back when, we're talking about, you know, way back when, started in the thirties going on all the way from there. So what you have there is people who have started coming together and dreaming up an emancipated Africa away from the colonies, because at that point there were still colonies and dreaming up all of that. So we're talking about people like Kwame Kuma of Ghana, we're talking about Julius Nyerere of Tanzania, talking about Blaise Diagne of Senegal and other people like that, Bandi of Malawi. So anyway, so, and the African youth of today, we're still hanging on to those, onto some of these ideas of, and on some of these dreams of a reunited Africa. So when you were talking about what seems to unite you, there is that, you know, also, meaning like we all feel like we're part of the same family. Is it only in our heads? Is it in reality? Many, for many different reasons, there is definitely what we call a Pan African movement. And I very much myself, consider myself one of them. I don't agree all the time with our, where we want to go and how we want to go there, but not where we want to go. Where we want to go is we would love to see a united Africa for sure. But how to get that accomplished, that's where oftentimes we have issues. So on something like that, so this Pan African, especially the Pan African youth, but it's beyond the Pan African youth, it's the youth in general in Africa, World Bank, UN, all of these organizations that they tend to qualify as imperialist organizations. And it's not always a correct way to describe them, but I'm sure you get the sentiment. And from that place, there is tons of resentment because for the longest time, these groups, organizations, and some that preceded them, have proceeded to actually decide what even our new frontiers would be. You see, when you go to a place like Senegal, Mali, all of that, different countries, but we were one people, one group, one kingdom. And then at some point they decided just, when you look at Africa, have you looked at how straight some of these borders are? You're like, did a robot just draw these? Really? No offense to robots. No offense to robot, especially this one, he looks so cute. But you know what I mean? So they have continued deciding what it would be to be us, to live on our land, and how do we even progress? And it just keeps on going. They get to decide how are we gonna, which type of even economic development path are we gonna choose or not? So it's very, so from that standpoint, yes, there's a lot of resentment, including even from people like me. Yeah, and it's interesting that the invader and the oppressor and the empires have actually created a force for unity. I've seen that in Ukraine and the invasion of Ukraine, where it was a pretty divided, not a pretty, a very divided country with many factions. But the invasion really forced everyone to think about the identity of this nation together, beyond factions, beyond all of that. It allowed it to look at its history and its future. Like they all say that all great nations have had to have a war of independence. And this is our war to find our own identity. And so in that sense, Africa as one place, as one continent had to find multiple times its identity through the resistance of the oppressor. Especially subterranean Africa, especially subterranean Africa, yes. And there's an interesting aspect to this because the president of Senegal is also the head of the African Union. So we'll talk about the fascinating geopolitics of that whole situation. But let me ask in general, you talk about this question, this fascinating question, what does it take for a country to prosper? What does it take for a country to prosper? You see many countries in the world that really struggle and many that flourish. And it's not always obvious why because some have natural resources, some don't. Some have wars, some don't. Some have sort of authoritarian regimes, some don't. And some have democracies and all that kind of stuff. So the dynamics aren't exactly obvious. Is there commonalities? Is there fundamental ideas that result in a prosperity of a nation? Today, I can confidently say yes, despite all the differences that you talked about. And I think then this is where it becomes very important that we are very clear about the question you asked me. You said, what does it take to make a country prosperous? So I'm just gonna stick to prosperity because prosperity doesn't necessarily mean, sometimes it has nothing to do with maybe how you conduct yourself otherwise, socially speaking, right? So you can be prosperous. And still when it comes to your family laws, all the way you approach the other aspects of your life, maybe you're running a very communist lifestyle or you're in a very liberal society. So for me, when we talk about prosperity, I just want to make sure that we're clear on that because some people might say that, might be somewhere and be like, well, because I know what I'm gonna talk to you about next. And some people are gonna sit there and be like, well, China is not like that. Or even Dubai is not like that. No, so what I'm talking about is this thing. And that's what I love about this. If we just stick to the word prosperity. To me, I see prosperity as this. It's like, economically speaking, what are we gonna be to be a prosperous nation? Meaning we are a middle to high income nation. I'm not talking about what are the rights of your women to vote or can people live like this? Or I'm not talking about any of that. Economic, fundamentally economic prosperity. Because I think that distinction is very important because over the years, I've seen people push back on all types of things and it occurred to me that that's what the misunderstanding was there. So if we're gonna talk about prosperity, making sure that the country can make money so that it can take care of its needs and the needs of its citizens, then what I have come to find is that at the root of that is gonna be what we call economic freedom and what I call the toolkit of the entrepreneur. In that you can put the rule of law, you can put the concept of clear and transferable property rights. Economic freedom is at all the levels that which will allow entrepreneurs and business people to create value and create value entrepreneurially. We're not talking about rent seeking or anything like that. It's like you found a pie to be this big and you make it this big. So that's what we're talking about. Create value. Create value, yes. So when it comes to that, we have found that whether you're looking at two countries that start out the same, we're talking the same people, East Germany, West Germany, South Korea, North Korea, very similar people to start with, right? But yet radical outcomes. I know that today Germany is united, but we're talking about back in the days when you had East and Western block. Same people, very different outcomes. Like I said, South Korea, North Korea, and so on and so forth. And at the same time, very different nations. Dubai compared to Singapore or to England, very different yet the same outcome. So it seems to me like whenever we're looking at prosperity, if a nation is prosperous, regardless of whatever other shenanigan they might be running, whatever other operating software they might be running for anything that's not related to business, if on the business side, they are proponents of a free markets or at least a base level of free markets, we know that such countries will create prosperity. So what are the aspects of the operating systems that lead to Singapore and to South Korea and all that kind of stuff? So can you speak to different elements that enable the toolkit for entrepreneurs? Sure, sure. And maybe here, let me just maybe illustrate it with my own story and then I can take you back to... Yeah, what's your... Oh my God, tell us your story. No, no. Who are you? It's just because it started with me coming here. You showed me the robot and everything and now it looks like we know each other for too long. And then you're like, tell people. No, no, no. But so this is where this question, even when you asked me, how do some countries become prosperous? I call it courage. It's the courage to show up with curiosity, with empathy and with love. To me, those three are the antidote to pretty much anything. Curiosity and love. In the face of fear, can you show up with curiosity? In the face of hate, can you say, I'm gonna engage with love? Even if I'm scared to death and even if I'm pissed off to death by this, but can you do that? In the face of just like, you know, judgment or whatever, can you show up with empathy? And I had just found that when you try to do that, you engage very different parts of your brain. That's proven by the way, by the brain scientists, but you also can feel it in your body that you're engaging very different parts of your soul. And so I try myself, I'm not always good at it, but it's a practice that I try to honor, which is curiosity, empathy and love. As I told you offline, those, I agree with you 100% on that, but there is, you know, when you go to Ukraine and you can say, you can speak about the power of love, but when you lose your family, when you lose your home, all you have in your heart is hate. Even if you know it, you're not supposed to have it. You still, all you have is hate. So sometimes it's a very human thing to have resentment, to have hate. But it is about trying not to stay there. And it's okay if it takes you years, but it is about trying, and I mean the word trying, it is about trying not to stay there. Let me ask you about some of the things you see in this country from your perspective of everywhere you've been in the world. What do you think about the Black Lives Matter movement here in America that does struggle with the role of skin color today and throughout the history of this country, maybe even throughout the history of the world? Well, Black Lives Matter has been a very hard one for me, because do Black Lives Matter, those three words together in that order, what they mean, they mean everything, because Black Lives do matter, as any other lives do matter. But I know in this case why they say Black Lives Matter, because some of the context we have had. Now, while I agree with the principles that Black Lives Matter, I have a big problem with the organization. With the organization and what it stands for. When I have an organization that pretends to want to stand for Black lives to matter, yet you are self proclaimed Marxist socialists, I pause. Why? I pause and then I'm like, have we learned nothing? Have we learned nothing? And the reason why I say that, Lex, is because 60 some years ago, it started before even 60 some years ago, Black people, in this case, I'm talking about the African people, I'm talking about the Black Africans who would go on to really cement this concept of African emancipation and African liberation. And here I'm taking us back to 1945. They had four of them before that. But in 1945, in Manchester, UK, happened something that would become major for Africa and its future, especially subterranean Africa. In Manchester, UK, people like Blaise Diagne of my country, Nyerere, Tanzania, Kwame Nkrumah, Ghana, and others and others from different parts of the continent got together with Marcus Garvey and W.E.B. Dubois. And I say Dubois because that's how we say it in French. He has a French name, French sounding name at least. And Americans would say, so for Americans listening, I know you say Duboy, but it's Dubois. No, because just in case they're like, who is he talking about? That's who I'm talking about. So all of those people got together in the UK and with W.E.B. Dubois and Marcus Garvey, big top African American intellectuals of their times. W.E.B. Dubois had so many things happen to him, starting from the North, being more or more or less a liberal type guy. You know, came to the South just to see at this time, you know, people, black people being lynched and some of the body parts been shown in store windows. I mean, just for a second, we put ourselves in his shoes. I put myself in his shoes. And that's when he started to become radicalized, right? Because at first it was like, oh, reforms, and I was like, God darn it. And I mean, these people, we don't talk to them. We force, you know. And eventually, little by little, things going through. Yeah, you have these people, they're very much on the Marxist socialist train. So do you think the sort of, it's the political movements that are just using? Yeah, because what happened back in those days, it is true. But to their credit, communist socialists were fighting for equal rights. They were fighting for equal rights. They were fighting for the rights of black people to have equal rights. So of course, I could see why one could say, especially in this times, you've been lynched, bodies burnt, body parts showcased at window stores. Meanwhile, in Africa, under colonization, in your own country, in your own land. And you have this group that's saying, your fight is part of what we fight. And you have this group that's saying, your fight is part of what we fight. Of course, you're gonna say I side with you, especially if this is all happening at a time where, you know, so 1945, these guys who would be the liberators of various African nations, they're meeting with Garvey, with W. E. B. Du Bois. And that's where this meeting is very important. It's the fifth Pan African Congress meeting. It's very important. It's gonna be the last one, but it's the most important one because that's when they formed their plans and really rallied around this concept of African emancipation and African liberation. We're gonna liberate our countries. Then later, so that's how all of these movements started to happen. And from there, Gandhi was already making some progress with India, you know, getting them out of British rule and all of that. So all of this was happening and it really like, this whole thing was bubbling, bubbling, bubbling, you know, like there's like a new force going on. And then we arrive in the late fifties and, you know, Kuma with, you know, them with the British as well, they might manage to become their colonization is over. They're the first one to go in, 57. Then from there, it's what we call the independences. That's what most of Sub Saharan African nation are getting their independence is different dates. Mine, April 4th, 1960. So all over, so this is happening. And now think about it. You're talking 57, you're talking 60. We're like at this time now with the middle of a Cold War. Because we have to put things in context if we wanna understand what's going on. Because people today ask me, why do you think, because even now when they understand, oh, you're right, it makes sense. If you have no economic freedom, you're gonna be poor. But why, why, why did they go for this? Why did they go for this? And then they don't understand. So that's what happened. So beginning of day of times, pre colonial Africans were free marketeers, free enterprise. It's pretty well recorded by someone like George Aite. That's where I got the cheat I think from and Ghanaian economist. And then slavery happened, colonialism happened. And then the independences, late fifties, early sixties for most sub Saharan African countries. So there what you have is, but then what happened there? So I told you in 45, fifth Pan African Congress in the UK with the liberators of Africa under the leadership because he was the wise, you know, eldest man. Dubois was, he was in his seventies back in the day. So he's older than them, you know, and he's coming with all of his ideas and everything. So they're like, ooh. So there they are. Now we're in the late fifties, early sixties. We're starting to make progress with the independences. You know, India has gone there before. So all of that is starting to happen. And at that time, remember, they already were being introduced to the concept of socialism, Marxism, all of that way before by some of these, you know, black African American intellectuals of their time who were very socialist Marxist by that time. So now they're becoming independent because I do independent like this because I reckon that there's still neocolonism going on. So now this is happening, they're becoming free. But then you look around, what do you see? That now most of these liberators of their nations become the president of the nations. But remember what I told you? Most of them have dranken the Marxist socialism Koolaid. So as these African nations become independent with their first independent governments and, you know, presidents, most of them, most of them are socialist, various forms of statist type of government. And this is because at that point, we had made a fatal mistake of going, of saying we are Marxist socialist because you guys fight for equal rights. So in this case, there should be no colonialism or anything like that. So not only you have that going on and the people, so right now you had this battle of ideology going on because on one end represented by freedom and the economic, what do you call it? The economic system they were using is capitalism. And these are represented by the Western nations facing off with Eastern block, practicing various forms of statism, socialism, communism, various forms of statism. And these two are fighting for influence. So, and we also have, it's also not, so two things there. One is we're at a time where, remember the free market concept was almost dead, almost dead. So almost every intellectual at that time was social Marxist or Marxist socialist, I put the name, that's what you were. So you're in a world where it was a normal thing, it was just mainstream acceptance. So not only you have that force, but at the same time, if these two forces are fighting one another, it turns out that the one representing capitalism and freedom, well, sorry, but isn't it you who enslaved us and colonized us? And you're fighting with the people who represent, supposedly people who are saying that who had been fighting for equal rights for us, with us for the longest time, these are our friends. And that's when we made a fatal mistake because while yes, there were maybe good things to agree on with Marxist socialist of the times, especially equal rights for all people and all of that, that's the only thing we should have, among the only things we should have agreed upon. There are violent revolution tendencies, no way. When it comes to the economic nonsense, no way. We should not have thrown the baby out with the bathwater, but that's what we did. And that's when we made a fatal mistake. So then we became free, all of these nations, and most of them started with socialist or communist leaders. My country, socialist, Léopold Sédar Senghor, he was a socialist. And they stayed in power for 40 years, the first 40 years of our freedom years. And all over the continent, more or less, that's what you had. And on top of that, something else that the French don't know, the people don't know is France with its colonies said, you cannot, not do, you have to keep the French civil law. So we're talking about the Napoleonic civil code. Are you kidding me? So that's what happened. So the reason why I go back to BLM is while I have all the respect in the world and all the compassion in the world for people like Krummer, for people like Nyerere, for people, all of us people of those times, the liberators of Africa, while I have so much love, compassion for them, I am also able to say, because I got the benefit of 60 some years time, and where you get to do a debrief and see what worked, what didn't work, what happened. We have had the 60 years to look back and to reflect. So yes, I can understand why they did what they did. I can understand why they sided with these people who on the surface, or at least some part of a fight was the same fight as them when it came to equal rights. I can excuse them, but I will not excuse the BLM founders because that mistake was tolerable 60 some years ago. Today, no. The blacks of today cannot be serious about black lives mattering and saying in the same sentence, and we're going to be socialist Marx, Marxist socialist. It just doesn't work. So the BLM movement is too deeply integrated with the ideas of Marxism. Yeah, they're anti free market, anti capitalist. And we do know that you have to have the free markets in order to build prosperity. And prosperity means economic power. If you have economic power, no one messes with you, or if they're gonna do it, they're gonna have to think twice. And when they do, they're gonna have to pay consequences. So if you want for blacks to be respected anywhere in the world, you're gonna have to be serious about black prosperity, all mass, not just a few people, Oprah over here and somebody over there, no. We as a group have to be critical mass of prosperity across the board. And because we're talking critical mass of prosperity across the board, it means black people everywhere in the world. But guess what? We in Africa happen to represent 90% of our representatives of a black race. So you're gonna be serious about black lives mattering without being serious for Africa, the 1 billion people in Africa that are black and for them to have access to the free markets and yes, fossil fuels, so that they can rocket up prosperity wise. And the resources of the young people, the young minds. So that all of these young people, young minds can finally manifest their greatness that I know they have and that they're showing us every day despite the obstacles. That's what we need. Senegal becomes rich and Senegal can become and will be richer than France. Singapore did it, we can do it. Mali rich, Nigeria rich, functioning as well. Malawi rich, Tanzania rich, Uganda rich, Zimbabwe rich, Niger rich, everywhere rich prosperous as prosperous, if not more prosperous than Switzerland or Singapore or the U.S. I don't know, or the Lichtenstein or Luxembourg, places that have no natural resources. We become rich and you watch the world having a very different relationship with us. That's the only time we will commend any type of respect. That's when people, even our common psyche will change even about black people. All of the stereotypes that they have of us is gonna melt away. And you may still not like us, but you will still respect us because we are a force to be dealt with. And only economic power does that. It would be nice, of course, for us to respect people because they're people. It would be nice, but let us not kid ourselves. This is earth. And someone said, nice people will make it to heaven, but not to Harvard necessarily. It's true. It's interesting that pity does not ever turn into respect. It would be nice if it did. It would be nice, but it doesn't. Prosperity is the only thing. Prosperity is the only thing. And the way we do that, there is no, just like all of us humans have to inhale oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide. That's a human way of breathing. You bring me on, but you wanna be foolish and be like, oh, well, sorry. That's how white people breathe. So as black people, we're gonna have to do something different. Well, good luck with that. Right? So this is here why I'm saying, I have no patience for Black Lives Matter. They're making a mistake that was made 60 some plus 60. Years ago, even more than that. Maybe even a hundred, you know, when we were siding with the Marxist socialists because they're the ones who've been fighting for equal rights. Let me ask you though, about racism. Do you, as you travel through this world, as you travel through America, feel the burn of hatred? You've spoken about the revolutions that have been fought throughout the 20th century against racism. But today, as people talk about educating, reminding the world with the, even with more philosophical ideas of critical race theory, for example, do you think this is still a battle that needs to be fought at the forefront of culture in the United States? Um, does racism exist? Yes, it does. But all forms of isms exist. Some people, it's about various forms of ableism. Others, it's about size. And racism, yes, is one of them. Does it exist? Yes, it does. But is it what's gonna stop anyone from manifesting their greatest potential? I say no. I say no. Many people in this country have showed it. Whether they're African Americans or African immigrant, I'm an African immigrant. You have African Americans like Oprah and others, and other people even before her, who despite the nastiness around them, were able to make it. So we do know, especially as black people, but I think it's humanity as a whole. And that's what I love about the human spirit. It's resiliency. But resiliency only can happen if you don't allow yourself to be beaten down and to lose yourself of agency. It's, of course, easier said than done. And some among us need a little bit more help to not succumb for it than others do. And I've seen it. It might be harder for you if you're somewhere in inner city, inner city black America. Maybe the environment might be a little bit tougher for you to try and get your act together and all of that stuff. And it's okay. But even in that situation, we need to, I think it's important that we still do not rob you of your agency. And this is where I am mad as heck against those who supposedly care and their idea of how to make sure that I don't become or stay a victim of racism is through all the things we talked about, the CRT, the anti racism crap of, you know, Ibrahim X. Kendi and what's her name, Robin DiAngelo. I mean her, I'm shocked. The woman is making all of this money supposedly fighting a war on our behalf. I'm like, lady, I hear you loud and clear that you are a true racist. I know, but you told me you are. And for you to think that your anti racism makes you less racist and it's, that happens too. She comes from a racist background. Fine, she's saying it, it's true. But this idea that every walking person on earth belongs to one category or the other, depending on what, you know, which skin color you came with, it's problematic at its root. So my point is, does racism exist? Yes. Do you think it's gonna stop me from doing anything I have to do? No. Might it make it harder, longer? Maybe, but it will not stop me from doing anything. But it will not stop me. But for it not to stop me, I can't engage in victimhood mentality. I can't lose myself as self. I got to use all the agency that I have to fight back and fight beyond. See, it's just a bit of fight back. You fight back and you fight beyond. Cause at some point, yeah and. It's this concept of yes and. So this is why I have loved the job. So when I have somebody who is like, oh, anti racism is a way. We're gonna go and tell all the white kids that, you know, because they will happen to be white, that they're really the oppressors and blah, blah, blah. And the black kids, because they're black, you know, you're not changing anything when you're doing that. Nothing except that you're causing, you're putting problems where there were no problems to start with. All we had to do was maybe go for a different route from there. Kids are kids. Kids are born kids. And this, I'm not sure if you want to get me going onto the whole science of bias, because that's something I spent years of my life on. And my journey on the science of bias started with the days of Philando Castile, Eric Garner, that whole summer of 2016, when we had this horrendous, horrendous situation of black people being killed by the police, where they shot before asking, and people left to die in the most inhumane way for the rest of us to watch from the social media. That's me. That's when my George Floyd moment happened. Not later than four years ago, and the whole world is like, you know. So that sent me on a journey of understanding what discrimination is and bias is. And in a way, that's the reason why I started this company that I even called Skinny Skin. That's where it came from. Again, criticized by creating. I needed to understand what discrimination was. How does it work? Is it true what Kendi is saying? Is it true what DAngelo is saying? Is it true that it could be that your race is just because of the skin color you happen to be born in? Is it true? Is it true? I needed to know, because I was at a time of my life where at some point, you know, when those killings were happening, it was so hard for me being a black person in this country. And wondering, I mean, what is this? And what do we do with this? Yeah, is it true? How much discrimination am I operating under in the system? All of that. You need to understand the full characteristics of, if you're dreaming of making a big change by building companies, you have to kind of intuit, how much, what am I up against? What am I up against, right? And so this is why, you know, spend all of this time on some of the work. And then eventually I understood that discrimination, if you wanted to understand it beyond, it's, you know, beyond the big lines of, especially the clickbait lines would make it very black and white. Then I had to really take a moment and I spent time, you know, with a world of brain scientists, with behavioral psychologists, with evolutionary biologists. We have all of this ecosystem, but together form what one might call the science of bias. And especially I came across the work of this team of scientists at the University of, I think it's Wisconsin, and they're the only ones who made sense in this sea of nonsense back then. And this article was in Politico, and it was saying something that I could relate to it. And eventually what I learned was, and this part comes from the evolutionary biologist people, they in a way tell you that right around age three, can happen sooner or later, because you know, we're all different, but you go from this person who has to rely on these other people, usually your parents, to stay alive, to be fed, to be housed, to be in your diaper change, all of that stuff, right? To now, something is kicking in. Where you have to, in order for you to survive, and this is all wired in, so you don't even understand it consciously, as I'm saying it now, where in order for you to survive, in order for you to go from this state of dependency to the next stage and more and more and more, you're gonna have to develop this ability to make sense of the world. And what's making sense of a world at its most basic level means is, can you determine if a situation or a person is good or bad for you? Failure, and you need to be able to do so ever so quickly, because failure to be able to do that means that you might not be alive the next second. See, it's so wired in. So this process is starting to kick in. And at that point, your brain is gonna be your best ally for that. And what the brain is gonna do is it's gonna help you, and the way the brain works is through, it works with, it's all wired for efficiency. And the way it goes for efficiency is through automation, meaning that every time it has computed, and you probably know these things way better than me, every time it has computed one algorithm, it doesn't want to do it again. It's almost like this, okay, got it, stored, stored, right? And then it adds maybe some little levels of complexity to it, but it has to be something new, meaning the new level of complexity for it to even be willing to reconsider. Otherwise you have, so then all of a sudden what you have is these neurons in the back of your head, and they have created pathways, right? So, and every time neurons have created pathway among themselves, because basically they're attached, and here is the pathway, well, this pathway in the world of, in the world of science of bias, it's a habit. In general, it's a habit when they form two pathways, when they form a pathway, it's a habit. So if we're willing to talk about unconscious bias, because of course it's very different from somebody who tells me to my face, there's no world in which you or I could ever be equal, because you're black and I'm white, you're a woman, I'm a man, this, this and that, that people like that, again, 1% of psychopaths in our world, they're out there, unfortunately, by the time they do nasty things, it's pretty horrible, and that's what all we hear about, but I'm talking mostly about the rest of us. Remember when I told you that most of us are good people, bumbling along, making it up as we're going, and that's why I have compassion for human nature. So, but really, in the morning when I wake up, do you really think that I'm waking up and thinking, how am I gonna go kill? How am I gonna kill? How am I gonna kill? And I wake up and thinking, how am I gonna go kill? How am I gonna go kill Lex? That Lex guy needs to go down, he's a man, he's a, don't take me wrong, I'm sure there are some women who feel like that, but I'm not one of them, and I do think a majority of us are not, whatever. But you know, in the morning I'm waking up, I'm just like, gee, can I get my tea? Oh, my dog is not looking okay today. You know, we've got, right? It's a lot going on, and so you're using these kind of, just like you said, brilliantly, it has a bunch of simplifications that's built up, and it uses those simplifications to get through the day. To get through the day, exactly. So then here you are, needing to make sense of a world, and then the brain is your best ally in that. The way it's gonna do it is through efficiency, efficiency done through automation. So every time it thinks it's figured something out, it's never gonna think about it again, so that's how you build all of these habits of unconscious bias, because everything, so it's somewhere along the line, you come up with the information that black man walking around with a hoodie equals danger. So later, what do you see? Whether it's Lex or my gut, I'm walking in the dark alley, I see a black man with a hoodie, maybe I'm gonna run away because I've been given that information. So the best way to think about it is the brain is a hardware, and the software it runs on is, what do you call it? Is a cultural imprint. All of this information that we're getting from the Disney movies that you're reading, telling you that damsels are to be saved by the prince and all of that stuff, and girls wear pink and all, whatever. You watch the movies, and all the movies, whenever you watch images about Africa, they're talking to you about the blood diamonds, or they're talking to you about slavery, or they're talking to you about this, and then no wonder you walk away thinking that all the ills of Africa are caused because of resource extraction, the diamonds, or they're always fighting each other, look at Idi Amin in the movie, or slavery all the time, you walk away and this is it. And we all programmed along the same lines, see that's the beauty of it. All of us are, because even some black people who are gonna claim that they didn't visit up when they registered, really? So the truth, so then when I learned all of this, I'm like, wow, this concept of if you've got the brain, you've got biases, it comes with the territory, that makes sense. Now, it doesn't mean we can't transcend that function of a brain and that we should transcend it. But I think it's very important because once you understand that, a little bit more peace is created among us because this is not about a black and white, or a yellow and green issue, it's about we are human issue. And these are part of things we develop to stay around. Just like we no longer have to rely on this fear of flight, like ability of a brain because bears over there start running and running fast, right? Today, where are the bears? Show me where they are. But we have kept this tendency to go for fear of flight. I don't know how they say it. And so we have this courtesan done by the stress, stress triggers that back in the days, we have a stress trigger, we run, and it's all expelled out. But today we get triggers and we don't know what to do with it because where do we run to? What do we do? The bear is not even here. So same thing here with that. And so then you realize there's this whole thing that is now what you understand is that this problem is not about anti racism BS, but it is about can each one of us do the work where the work is needed, which is we look inside. Can we go for this work of deprogrammation? This concept of a mindful practice of undoing the habit of bias. And that doesn't necessarily have to do with a simple categorization of black and white. It's all kinds of biases. It's about everything. It's about everything. And when I started on that journey and my friend back then built this practice of undoing your habit of unconscious bias, we had all types of people come and say, wow, I discovered that my bias is against larger people. And I'm more like, what do you mean? Well, I think it seems to me like I felt that larger people maybe are dumb. No, we heard things and you don't judge. Yeah. You don't judge. And you see it's at every level. I don't know, like there's even this one friend, she was like, when I looked into the whole dating thing, I absolutely didn't want to date the Asian men because her mind was into some stereotypes about the size of whatever. And she was like, no. But you see, once you start, because there's this whole thing of, it's the five step thing, bias awareness. This, basically at this level, what you're doing is you're learning to spot the biases in our culture, because that's where the cultural imprint comes from. You're watching this movie and you're realizing, just like I said, wow, gee, I realized once again, the black person is portrayed like the fog of a movie. Or, you know, the Latina lady, this is how she's been portrayed. And you see it everywhere. Even the NPR, NPR is happening, like you're listening to something like NPR. It's gotta be more liberal than that. And this gentleman is asking these two candidates, one of them is a woman, political candidates, the other one is a man. I'm hearing him asking the lady a question that I know he's not gonna ask the man and he didn't ask her. He said, how do you balance your race with a family? Does a man not have a family? Right there, you see, it's very subtle. But you see, but because now my mind is kind of trained to see things, I'm like, interesting. Or like when the media just says, froze climate change issue on something without even the choice of words. So it's pretty much everywhere. You open a book everywhere. The interesting thing though, I mean, even that man, woman example, is I think it's really powerful to bring that bias to the surface, but not let that lead to kind of fear and paralysis. You should almost, I mean, that's where humor is, make fun of it, bring it to the surface, like acknowledge the fact that those things are a part of the conversation. And a lot of them are, it is, it's a cultural imprint because it's part of culture. And that might be, there could be, I grew up in the Soviet Union where the gender roles were stronger than in other places. And that's part of the culture. We have to acknowledge that this is how, this is affecting how I think. We might like how that works, we might not, but we have to acknowledge it and not get, make it part of humor, make fun of yourself, all that kind of stuff. That's the thing. And so that's why this first step is bias awareness. So you get, you train yourself, oh yeah, okay, that was one or it's, you know, and it's about, it's in you, we're talking about you, we're not. And then from there, you're like replace the bias, like bias replacement. Then it is where you practice the empathy. You're like, gee, wow, I wonder how I would feel every day I walk into a store and the guy thinks he should be following me because maybe I might steal something because I'm black. Because once you try that, to put yourself in the other person's shoes, all of a sudden something else starts to click. And then from there, you go on to making connection. Then you're making a connection and then things start to change because now you know, you're making, then you make cultural immersion. So this is where we had some people like this one woman, she was very quite, very feminist oriented. And she had an issue with women wearing the hijab. And because for her it was like, how come you, how come, how come you just lower, you know, like how come you're accepting this demeaning of yourself, not understanding everything else that comes with it. But through, as she understood that she even had that bias, then she went on through all the different processes. And then eventually when comes the next step, cultural immersion, she started going to the mosque during Ramadan when the Muslims are doing, you know, they're, it's the holy month of, you know, fasting and then we break at night. And she started understanding very different things. And eventually happens the last step that happens naturally, making a true, real, genuine connection. And this is where friendships happen. This is where that's it, your bias can go home now because it has been challenged with reality and understanding. And so for me, that is what I was after. And then, but then the world was just like, we don't want to be told we're part of a problem. So, but I still reckon that it is the type of mindfulness, type of practice that's going to need to happen. And it's one that's very internal to you. It is not, and it happens, everybody at their own pace. So all of this, I take it back to the racism, the question you were asking me. Does racism exist? Yes, it does. Is it going to stop me from doing anything I want to do? No. Is it going to make it harder? No. But this is where, for anybody who is serious about making sure, about fighting racism, I think the only job you have to do is to make sure that people keep their sense of self agency and B, can you help provide people with the tools to stand up? So this is why I have so much respect for Van Jones. People like Van Jones, although I disagree with him on so many things, but people like Ms. Alice Johnson, she was pardoned by President Trump through the work of people like Van Jones and Kim Kardashian and others. They all joined forces. This is a case where people of, and those folks then went on to combine forces furthermore, no regard given to their political belongings. They said, if the issue is criminal justice reform, then anybody who stands for it has to come together. And so what they did in this situation with what they're doing, criminal justice reform in my mind is a valid action to fight racism in my mind. Because what are you doing there? You're trying to get people out of jail who really have no business being there. And also when you have people like Bishop Omar and the people, he passed away, unfortunately, but today we have Anton Lucky, who was in jail for having killed his cousin. He had started, I think he started the gang in South Dallas. So we're talking really tough guy who was reading the wrong side of the equation. And then in jail, literally he found Plato, the cave and all that. So today these people, I'm like, why don't we hear more about them? The urban specialists. Because these people, it's not about the anti racism crap of Candy O'Donoghue, I'll say it again, until the cows come home, but it is about, we go where help is needed. We go in urban, inner city, inner city, black inner city neighborhoods and block by block we change the culture. And they say it like that, it's their words. These are African American people who have as many rights as anybody else to talk about their own culture. And they will tell you, we have to change the culture. I have some videos like that on my YouTube with Bishop Omar. What these people are doing is what we need to do. Bishop will explain and say, sometimes people are their feet and feet deep down in the mud. And what we have to do is to try to pull them up. And you cannot say you didn't pull them up because we're not seeing their head out yet, but how much progress have they made from the bottom to where they are now and keep going. So what I see these people doing, you see, I have so much, I love and respect Glen Lowry and company, and Ian Rove and all of those guys. I love them. I love a lot of the things that they say. This whole concept of personal responsibility, we don't know that. But I'm just like, at some point, it also needs to be matched up with real actions. And that's what the people like Anton Lucky, urban specialist, Alice Johnson are doing. They're going where it's hard. Alice Johnson is getting people out of jail every single day, literally. And then people like Anton Lucky and his team are giving them the tools to live the gang life, to be better people, to go for a life of redemption. This is happening right now. But what I find is they're not getting the bulk of the attention. But anybody who's serious about this is why, how I would love to see people do anti racism is help lift people up for real. Action. Support school choice. Support school choice. Black mamas, they know what's going on. And when they tell you we want school choice, they know what to talk about. They're not idiots. Especially at the local level. Yes. Helping them at the local level. Yes. So help them make sure that they can take their kids out of these public schools that are doing horrendous things to them. You know, Miss Virginia, watch that movie. How could you not support black moms in this country to take the kids to safety when it comes to education? How come not? That's what I want to see happen. And not like some, yeah, let's go to some classrooms and everybody's white. You go over here. Everybody's a next date. You go over here. And kids, let us tell you about this. No, no, no, no. As a black person, I don't want you to do any of that crap. Let me grow my wings. Yeah. If you want, help put some fuel behind them and let me take my flight. That's all I'm asking for. That's the only way for you to be part of a racism battle if that's what you think is the most important battle of our life. That's it. That's what I have to say about that. And so for me, I'm keeping my head very straight. It's about what enables black people to thrive. I don't need for you to be an activist on my behalf. No, because when you're doing that, you're doing exactly what you've been doing to us black people in Africa our whole life. I don't need your white savior complex because that's what anti racism is. White savior complex. That stuff doesn't work. It only works to make you feel better about how superior you are to me. But it does nothing, absolutely nothing to change my everyday life. If it is not, if it is at least in the African side to actually even change my, turn me into somebody who's waiting for handouts. So I would encourage people to really, those people who are really serious about wanting to be part of a solution. And I know there are many out there for the love of God and everything that's out there and we care about, stop. It's about, think about what's gonna enable people. Maybe the word is wrongly chosen, but know what I'm talking about. Give them the freedom to spread their wings. Yes, give a person, teach a person how to fish and don't give them a fish. When you're putting your stupid signs on the lawn with Black Lives Matter and all that crap, you're not helping. And when you're buying one more anti racism book or as a company, financing one more DEI, if it done along those lines, I think we've got a problem. Yeah. So you do think that the efforts of diversity, equity and inclusion are often not effective. Not only are they not effective, but they also backfire and there are reports on all of this. And at the end of the day, it makes sense. It makes sense. So for me, I am very, very glad that people have developed an enlightenment about this. Very happy about that, very. But let us not keep going for the easy perceived solution to problems. Again, they've done this to us, the poor people of Africa. They thought the solution was to give. It does not work. And then they say, oh, we're gonna do social entrepreneurship on you, Tom shoes, buy one pair of shoes and we give one pair of shoes to some people in poor countries. Then guess what happened to us? You know, in the town where we operate in Senegal, where I have my little manufacturing, we have 2000 little mom and pop businesses. And guess what they happen to be in Lex? Shoemakers, right? So every shoemakers, each one of them hires at least five, 15 people. Do the math, family businesses. Guess what happens to them the day the Tom shoes truck shows up with bunch of free shoes. Yeah. Who can compete against free? Now, all of these people, little by little gonna have to close their shops because who can compete against free because Tom shoes dumping all of his shoes on them. And then they go out of business and now instead of helping anybody, you actually sent all the kids who depended on these adults working in these places. Now they have to join the rank of kids who need to be given shoes because you took their parents ability to make money through their wages, buy them shoes. You see? So first they said, we just have to give. So that was primarily, you know, the charity business. And you still have foreign aid business going on. So we just need to give. And then the social entrepreneurs came in place, but I'm like, the only person for this business is good is for Blake McCarthy, you know, the founder of Tom shoes. But other than that, I'm not sure really seeing who else is winning from this. And then they, and so today my whole thing is we got a challenge to have a mind for the poor or to have a mind for the lesser fortunate, maybe in this country, it is easy. And lesser fortunate, you know, for anybody that you feel like is being trampled upon because of something, maybe it's because of economic circumstances, or maybe it's race in this case, whatever. To have a heart for the lesser fortunate among us, for whatever reason, that's easy. But to have a mind for them, that's the challenge. Let me ask you a difficult question. Yeah. As if we were not already asking difficult questions. The president of Senegal, Macky Saw, is also now the chair of the African Union. He met with the president of Vladimir Putin on June 3rd. I think primarily was to discuss food security. Africa seems to be split halfway on their perspective in the war in Ukraine. So broadly speaking, what do you think about this? First of all, the geopolitics of Africa and the geopolitical relationship of Africa with the rest of the world and this current conflict with the war in Ukraine. What are your thoughts there? Well, you've seen that many countries when it was time to vote, some of them abstained, which in a way says something. I think for the Africans today, especially as represented by the African Union, because not all countries fall along the same lines, I feel like, again, we're back to way back. For the longest time, the West tries to tell us what to do. They decide for us. And here, there's trouble, meaning there's definitely a rift, major one, between most of the Western world as represented by Europe and America primarily, and you have Australia and all that. And then they're saying, I think this is more or less an attempt to stand on their own as well. It's like, don't tell us what to do as usual. You always rope us in with, when it makes sense for you, you try to rope us in, and then we're left hanging on our own. So this goes back to the sentiment you were talking about earlier. It's been challenging for me to watch this because remember, I have one foot also, because there's what I get to see and hear from being in the Western world, but there's also what I get to see and hear from when I'm back home. So I wear all hats. And I think this is a situation where the African Union and African nations in general are saying, this is a case where almost like, you guys are fighting, you guys are fighting. Maybe for once, we have to watch out for ourselves. Yeah, there's a sense in which this is the embodiment sort of abstaining from a vote on the war in Ukraine is a political embodiment of a resistance to the influence of the West. It's not about the war between, whatever you guys are fighting. It's saying, we're not going to let this particular empire that seems to be at the top right now, which is the United States empire in Europe, to dominate our political discourse, our geopolitical considerations. It's almost like, no, we're not touching this. Yeah, especially that given usually. So when they need us, again, for influence, which means more power, oh, you guys vote the same way we do. And when it's all over and they go back to spreading, they go back to, how do you say that? They go back to exchanging and sharing between themselves the goodies of their Halloween collection. We're no longer, we're not there when the goodies are being shared. So I think it's definitely one of those situations. But for me, it still is hard because I watch everything that's going on and it's going to be complicated, the ramifications of all of this. I would like to see our African leaders also, what they're doing is clear, but this is a place where I'm also tempted to say, yes and. Yes to the reasons you're advancing right now, we don't want to be always siding because we're tired. We're tired of always being dragged around and taken for granted and you vote our way. Come on guys, when you need us, we're great and everything is good. And then when it's time to go and share the goodies, we don't exist anymore. And you actually go for policies that go against us. But in this situation though, I would like to still see us do the right thing. In my case, I was not very happy to see us going and more or less begging for, what do you call it? Cereals, oh, please let the cereals make it. So at least we get them and we don't starve. I can understand why a president would say something like that or try to negotiate something like that. But when it comes to an African president having to do that with a non African president, I'm sorry, but for me, it's too close to begging. Listen, it's hard to be a leader, it's such a difficult dance because in some sense, sort of the flip side of that is you're creating a market, a geopolitical market of saying, we're willing to sit down at the table with America, with European leaders, with Russian leaders, with China, and we're gonna let you guys convince us who we should collaborate with. And that's what sort of great nations and groups of nations do. Now, there's a cynical, of course, a dark perspective on that because what's in that game played by leaders, the people that hurt, people of Ukraine hurt, people of Africa can hurt. People of Russia. People of Russia can hurt, people of China, people of United States, but it is the way of the world. And to earn, you have to earn respect and sometimes earning respect leads to the suffering of many. Well, but except in this case, yes to all of that. And the reason why I'm actually upset with going and being like, oh, can you let at least the boats that are supposed to come to Africa full of cereals come over, the wheat and all that? It's just like, look, Africa has the highest land that you can do agriculture on. Yes. You know? We have a larger surface, such surface in the world. Why is this not a time for us to try to win ourselves off of cereals that we don't necessarily have on the ground? But no, let us go and plead. Don't beg, create instead. Create instead, exactly. This should have been, you know, just like how the rest of the world when COVID happened and China had to close off for different reasons and since then has not, you know, completely reopened and people have started to realize, wow, we've got too much, we're too dependent on China for a lot of what we need. So we're gonna have to bring back some production to the US, the Europeans are doing the same, all of that. This should have been a time for African leaders to be like, we need to be serious now about, you know, food security. And maybe the stuff that maybe don't grow under our climates necessarily, can we work on coming up with different things? Now I understand that it can take time, but if I knew that that was happening at the same time that we're saying, oh, well, let the cereals come in, maybe I would be a little bit easier with it. But right now I'm just like, is it gonna be the same business as usual? And in this case, I'm just like, are we gonna go, are we gonna keep going from one masa to another masa? I mean, really? The interesting aspect of all of this is if we look at all of human history, it's possible that the 21st century is defined by Africa. It will be. And the young people, the huge number of young people, it's like the trajectory could be, there's so much possibility to define the future of human civilization in Africa. And I don't mean sort of in the next 10 years, I mean in the next 50 years. So some people are concerned about overpopulation. Some people are concerned about us dying out as a human species. And both of those people live in us. Talk to me often about that. I know, I know, I know, I know who they are. What's your, in Africa is at the center of this because there is a vibrant, huge number, probably over a billion people. Yeah, we're 1.3 billion people and of those, one billion blacks. I mean that, where do you land on that? There is a reason why I say I'm haunted, that I'm obsessed, that I'm monomaniacal when it comes to the free markets and that I have such a strong sense of urgency to the point that literally it is affecting me. And it has to do with the fact that yes, you have the youngest region on earth in terms of the age of its population and the rate at which it's growing demographic wise, I am not willing to stay there and say, it's a curse for humanity, but it will be a curse for humanity if we don't make sure that these people, our youth gets to partake. And what it takes to partake is not much. So if the rest of the world thinks that get to partake means you have to send more foreign aid, you have to have more charity businesses, I mean charity organizations sending stuff away, of course, you're almost thinking parasites. I'm sorry to say it this way, if this is what you're thinking, you're seeing us as no more than parasites. And if that's what it's gonna be, I could see why some people might be worried about that. Although humans should never be seen as parasites, That question, Lex, I had it when I was seven or so. That's when my family moved me to South Korea to from Senegal for the first time of my life, I left my country, I left my continent and I was headed to Europe to go join my people, my family, my parents who were there as economic migrants. My parents had migrated for a better life as so many people have to, so many people have to coming from poorer places, coming from low income countries. You saw the difference? Yes. Between the two places. How else would you call it? Here you are in Senegal, minding your own business, causing tons of trouble everywhere, just being a happy free wrench kid that I was. Yeah, so you were always a troublemaker, not just now. Okay, great. Life wouldn't be fun without it. Yeah, of course, I agree. Right? So, because even you, and you're all put together front, I know there's a lot of troublemaking behind you. Desperately trying to keep it together. I know you are, but with me, I'm gonna totally bring it out. So just, yeah. So. So you saw the difference. Right, I saw the difference. I'm walking in here, back home, and I tell people this story because to me it's a defining story. Back home, to take a shower, it takes time. Grandma has to make the charcoal catch on a little stove like you use when you go camping. And then she puts a pot of water on it, it boils. She takes it, puts it in a bigger bucket, mixes it with some colder water. Then we put a little pot in it, and a stronger member of the family has to drag it to the shower. And then there, finally, I can proceed to take my shower. Here I'm in Germany in the middle of the winter, and my mom's like, my god, time for your shower. I'm like, I'm not getting naked. Where is the bottle? Where is the bucket of hot water? She's like, oh, you silly, come on, just jump in. And I jump in the shower, turn the buttons, the water is coming down temperature. I'm like playing with. It's like, are you kidding me? So amazing. I've been cheated out of life my whole life. So that's what happened. And then I'm like, oh, and all of these roads, they're paved roads. And like back home, everything is like sandy, and my feet are always ash. I always have to wash off when I go back home, and your shoes get ruined most of the time. And it started, and I had this question, and it was just like, wow, how come they have this? And we don't. So I was not being like, oh, you know, how come they have all of this money? I was not, it was just like, how come? And I think what I was alluding to was, how come life is so easy here, and back home it's not? And easy, not in a negative sense, in a beautiful sense. Sometimes I get, you know, just having traveled through the war zone, just to come back, traveling through Europe, back to America, it just, I'll just get emotional just looking at the efficiency of things, like how easy it is, how we can, first of all, in Ukraine, you currently can't fly, right? It's a war zone. Just even the transportation, you said roads. Yeah, the quality of roads in the United States is amazing. Just not, you know, many of the places that drive in Ukraine, you're talking about, I mean, really bad conditions of roads. And I'm sure in many parts of Africa and many parts of the world, the roads are even worse. Right, right. And outdoor, you know, having an indoor toilet is a fascinatingly awesome luxury to have. It is, it is. And don't take me wrong, Lex. Do we have some great roads now in many parts of Africa? Yes, main arteries, great roads, you're like, whoa, this is moving. Yes, we do. But definitely more today than in my time growing up. Do we have, you know, a country like Nigeria that just birthed six unicorns last year alone? Yes. Do we have the African youth out there being so amazing and, you know, living their lives? Yes, we have all of that. But it is still, unfortunately, just like we're scratching the surface. And those people still are getting all of that accomplished literally swimming through molasses. This is some of the most gross, immoral, unfair waste of human capital. And so that is the, started with you as a seven year old asking, wait a minute, how do amazing people in Europe do this and the amazing people in Africa don't? Yeah, and that's a key word, amazing. Because that's what I realized later because it was not always like that for me, amazing and amazing, right? I knew instinctively that of course we are amazing too. But so eventually the question became how, so I went from how come they have this and we don't to the country as I'm growing up and researching because it stayed with me. When I tell you I'm obsessed, I'm haunted. I am haunted. So you can laugh all you want, but it's, so the question became, the question became, how come some countries like the United States, Singapore are rich and some others like mine and many others in Africa are poor? That became the question. And along the line, like along the road, I continued on living my life, wondering about this question. And I've heard all types of reasons as to supposedly why that might be the case. Some people with a very straight face are still peddling the IQ fury, according to which, come on, darling, it's not your fault. You know, your skin color goes with a gene sequence that just doesn't allow you to be as smart as white people are. And it's not your fault, but just accept it. That stuff is still out there. It's very real. I and I have to hear it. And others would say to me, oh, it's just because, you know, you guys don't have adequate level of education. And I say, you know, maybe you gotta go say that to most of the street sellers you go see in Senegal. You go up to any of these, to many of these street sellers in Senegal, they are wading through cars and moving cars under the hot sun, fumes thrown at their face, trying to sell you anything that you think you might be able to use. Whether we're talking about an ironing board to an umbrella, to Q tips, to, you know, toothpicks, selling you whatever you need from your car, these are street sellers. And you ask them, dear, do you have any degree? Yeah, I have this great degree in math or in literature or whatever. Some very, very educated people. Yet they're right there, this is what they're doing. So that's just at scale wasted human potential. Thank you. So that has to do, the wasted human potential has to do now with the system, with something about the laws. Which is, yeah. Something about sort of the things that limit or enable the entrepreneur. Yes, because at that point I've heard this, you know, I heard people say, yeah, your IQ is no good. Yeah, you don't have enough degrees or you're not educated. Yeah, some people would even say, it's because you guys are malnourished, you're malnourished, you need to be fed. Others, oh, well, maybe I'll give you some shoes and maybe something is gonna change, whatever. And then, so I heard all of this nonsense, Lex, but you guess what, but guess what? None of them made sense. You know why it didn't make sense? Because if any of that crap was true, why, oh, why is it that my parents or any other people from these places, and oh, and by the way, some people call those places God forsaken land. That's also the type of cred you always have to hear when it's not just flat out, SHIT whole countries from, you know, one person a few years ago, president of this country. That sentiment is sometimes there. It is, it is. As I go on with my life, trying to find the answer to why are some countries like mine poor while others are rich, I'm hearing all of these reasons thrown at me. And then they make no sense because then how come then if my parents move as it is usually anyone else who moves from a poorer nation to a nation that supposedly is rich, all of a sudden they get to manifest the greatest potential. So I'm starting to think this has nothing to do with a person per se, because we're talking about the same person, same background, same name, features, everything. Now I'm starting to think maybe it doesn't have to do with a person. Maybe we're talking about something that has to do with a place that they came from or the place that they're going to. So this little thing is starting to be in my mind. Again, remember, this is not something that I woke up to overnight. I'm like, voila, I got my question. It took me for a long time. And I had to face off to have many different ideologies face each other. I had to really have a reckoning literally in my heart and in my mind. And so then that's what I'm thinking. It cannot be, no, no, no, it's the same people. It has to be about the place. It has to be about the place, but then what about this place? no matter, no matter, no matter. But some people will go there. Now, people are here. What are we gonna do, dispose of them? That's not an option. So the only option we have left is to make sure that people partake. And what partaking means is that people get included in them and are part of the systems that allow for human flourishing. And it doesn't, it's not much. In this case, it's about, can we be serious about the reforms? So we have free market zones, areas where people, where the flourishing can start to take place. The wealth that people will need to flourish, they don't need you to give it to them. But it's all about, can I let you fly? And you will make it happen for you and also for me. Every young African I see today, I realize how stupid the rest of the world is if they're not supporting what I'm trying to talk about. Cause even if you don't wanna do it because that's the right thing to do, which I think it is the right thing to do, your selfishness, maybe engage your selfishness. Cause this person right there, remember I told you seven billion geniuses, everybody came to this world with a piece of solution to the human problem. This person and that person and that person hold something for me because I'm part of humanity. This person might have a cure to a cancer that might take my wife out, the wife I haven't met yet. But this kid right here has it inside. And if I help this, if I make sure that this kid gets a chance to flourish and to manifest his genius or her genius, that trickle down many years later, comes straight back to serve me and the love of my life. If we can't see it any other way, maybe let's try to think about it that way. Cause it becomes a very good proposition at that point. So in this case, by 2050, Lagos, Nigeria will be the largest city in the world. The future is African, whether we want it or not. But is it going to be an African future where you have a youth being a ticking bomb? Because they have not, there's no hope. They stay in poverty because they belong to nations that don't even understand sometimes the importance of common law versus civil law. Because they're trapped in countries that don't understand that you need to make the legal framework to provide for better economic freedom. So you can unleash the genuineness, the awesomeness, the ingenuity, the industrious side of your young people, especially of your women, so that they build all the wealth that your nation is gonna need you to build. And with it, the respect that comes from that. See, we have a choice to make. And this is why I feel so, so, so restless about this at this point of my life. We just lost George Hayite. George Hayite is one of the few Africans that I knew who put this out. That's who I learned from. He's gone. And I feel a strong sense of urgency to not only bring back to the table that which he has been working on, but to also make sure that it gets seen. That's why being here talking with you today, it's, you have no idea. It's, people ask, if someone like you could say, what can I do? You did more than you could ever imagine by just allowing me to take this message to one more person. And because if we do this, the change is gonna happen somewhere down the line. So. Yeah, the ripple effects of all of that on the unlocking the human potential. It's unbelievable. All those people in Africa are building cool stuff, amazing things. Yes, yes, yes. So some are gonna be built stuff, others are gonna work on the reforms. So we're working on reforms, by the way. I'm the head of the Africa Center for Prosperity of the Atlas Network, the largest organization in the world working on taking down barriers of entry for entrepreneurs around the world in their respective countries. So we're doing great work there. I basically, all the, obviously all the think tanks we have in Africa right now, free market think tanks, and we wanna promote more of them to come up. And these are local solutions by local people for their local problems, always. That's where we draw the line. And so there, so we're working on reforms primarily and making people understand the free markets and the importance of it. But it is piecemeal legislation. It takes time. It is hard. By the time you accomplish something here, more crap has happened over here. More laws have been pounded up because you know how they fix a bad law most of the time. Whether it's in the US or somewhere else. Put other laws to kind of undo the law from before, but it keeps stacking up. And before you know it, where you should have one thing and it's clear, you have a hundred and they go against each other and then it's all, it's worse. So we have piecemeal legislation that's happening. Our teams are doing really amazing, fantastic work, especially the team in Imani in Ghana. We have a group in Burundi, in the Great Lakes. I mean, people are doing amazing work, amazing work, but we need to run faster. So while we keep, we help them running faster, we also have to unlock other things. And right now I'm working on one of my most craziest projects. Something bold, radical, crazy for some people. But I know we're not crazy because before us, Singapore has done it. You know, Hong Kong has done it. Latest, the most recent China with the SSEs, the special economic zones, some of the most radical free market zones in the world, they've done it. And oftentimes within a generation, meaningful change start to happen, right? So here, what I'm working on is this concept of, some call it charter cities, Paul Romer, others call it the free cities. And I like to call it startup cities. What these are is for us to think about, okay, if piecemeal legislation takes forever, while we have this demographic that's growing faster and faster in Africa, there is a discrepancy here between the progress we're making to set the right environment for business to prop up, and how many more people are coming to life, literally every day on the continent. There's a discrepancy here. And so, the ticking bomb is going faster than the progress we can make. This is a problem. So what some of us are working on is this concept of a startup cities and to say, piecemeal legislation takes too long. How about we continue doing that work, which is essential and critical, but at the same time, can we think of zones, and I like to call them also common law zones, where we basically try to have within the country an area where for business, I'm not talking about family law or any of that stuff, no one is touching your culture or anything like that, but we're just saying business wise, an enclave where you have the best practices from around the world, including yours, in terms of what constitute a great business environment and allow people in, like you get in freely or nobody's forcing you to go, nobody's forcing you to whatever. So basically, you're to think about this rather unoccupied plot of land within a country, think Dubai, on 110 acres of land, Dubai is thinking that in their case, they're like, maybe they decided, maybe Sharia law is not the best for business in their case. And they said, they looked around and were like, wow, but common law, especially British common law, seems like a very good one. So at that point, they decided for business only, not family or anything like that, which is gonna stand to Sharia or whatever. And so they said, we are gonna bring in, so they hired retired British common law judges to educate the law and train the people under there. And I'm oversimplifying, but at the end of the day, within a generation, Dubai became one of the top international financial centers of the world. It is what it is today. And in the case of the African nations, that zone can then spread. Yes, it can not only spread, but maybe let's say Senegal, if Senegal was to go for this, here you have this one, and then over there you have another zone. And then what they start to do is they're not all modeled the same way, because maybe this one is saying, hey, we wanna attract more, I don't know, maybe we wanna attract more medical research, right? This one is gonna be saying, maybe we wanna attract more crypto, or maybe it's gonna be more like us, we wanna be more about religious this or whatever. You know what I mean? So we wanted to fit more of this or that. And just kind of give the basics, the grounds, and then watch the magic happen on it, right? And so this is what we're working on. And the hope there, because some people are like, I know some people are like, you guys are crazy, but hey, I'm like, no, it's more or less the story of the Asian tigers. And most recently, most of China's progress, economically speaking, because some people might say, well, you don't want China, we're developing, you see. Even then I say, and it's okay, you can always do better, but we cannot deny what the magic that they have accomplished, what they have accomplished is nothing short of a miracle. 800 million people getting out of poverty in such a short amount of time. Yeah, exactly. So it's not, yeah, for the quality of life and the majority of the Chinese population. Yes, yes. Does something like that happen without problems? Of course not. And so the next person to do something just actually gets to learn from lessons, from lessons, that's all. And leapfrog. And leapfrog, and leapfrog, exactly. So for me, this is a promise. And the people are like, oh, but you guys are crazy. But I'm like, just like with everything, do you know how many attempts it took before the first flight, the Wright brothers took off? Do you know how many? And that's important. You try, you crash, you try, you crash, but each time you're going up higher and you want to get up for once, then you stay up longer. And before you know it, you're doing all types of things. So here's the same thing. And I tell people, listen, all I need is one success story. And then the sea change. People don't even wait for us. Everybody. But this is hard because it's the first time. But the good news is there are many groups working on the continent. There are some groups in Zambia. There's a zone there. Folks are doing something like this in Nigeria. We're part of a project there in Nigeria. The one that I'm most excited about, I cannot disclose the name of the country yet. But my god, I'm so excited by it. And I just know, I just know, Lex, it's going to happen in our lifetime. I hope so. It's a really powerful vision. And it's not being dramatic to say that the future of humanity depends on your success, that success in Africa. It's such an important continent. It is. In this century. It's the continent where everything started. And I think it's the continent where that continent has to finally, finally, finally thrive. We cannot, all of us, call ourselves an enlightened society as a whole. When you have such, when you have this, it's a humongous continent. Have you seen the size of it? You know? Yeah. It's hard to fathom, actually. Yeah. Exactly. And it has such ingenious people. Sometimes I look at my people. I have to tell you, I'm so proud of them, and the young people, especially. And you know, you would look at them. And you know, somebody said sometimes one day, and it was so true, they said, you know, we've seen poverty other places. But here, it is just, maybe somebody doesn't have money, but they have dignity. And it's true. Yeah. So everything else we can handle, and we will handle. You have to mark my word for this. This is going to happen. And our youth is amazing. You should see them. So full of creativity. And it doesn't matter. You know, you were telling me, what makes you different? Many things makes us all different. You know, the Rwandans are very different from the West Africans that we are. Rwandans, for example, never dance with their hips. They dance more like, you know, with this part of the body. West Africans hips? Us, it's hips all over the place, all the time. And it's, you know, more jumping, stuff like that. In Rwanda, you feel it's more like, you know, I mean, they remind me more of, you know, the ballet thing. Rwandans have a sense where, you know, they don't eat, you know, so much in public. It's not very well. It's something you do. Us, we are, the West Africans, we like to be loud. We're almost like the Italians of the continent. And then the Rwandans are more like, you know, the Swiss stuff. Actually, the country even looks like Switzerland. I mean, we're so different from one group to another. Then you go to the Congo and you see these guys, they're so crazy. We have a dress, I mean, les sapeurs. So we are a very different bunch. But you know what I love about us, what I love about my people? We are the manifestation of what resiliency means. And so everything we need is there. Everything we need is there. I will say that there's nothing wrong with the seed. Everything that's wrong with us is that pot that we put around us. So we're tired of being bonsai people. We need to be the tallest trees in the forest that we were designed to be. And so... And that can be fixed. And that can be fixed. And that's the beauty of it. And that's why I am so, I'm almost dizzy with, I get dizzy with hope. I know my history. I know my economics, my fellow humans and all of that. And we know that there's an unfailing recipe. And when it comes to that recipe, we have the hardest part of it. The one missing ingredient, which is the free markets. As we go around and talk and people start to understand and each country tries to figure out, okay, where do we go there from here? I know that I will die with my continent having taken the right shift for a turn. I don't have to see where it ends because I cannot in my wildest dream imagine where it's gonna end. But I know it's gonna be, yeah. So my only job is to get this message out and then let my people do with it what they wanna do. That's all. Yeah, the scale of impact is just boundless. It's kind of cool. I mean, sometimes we think about individual problems and how do we solve them? We look up at certain individuals, like the, I don't know, Steve Jobs and Elon Musk. But it's so much more powerful to just, without knowing what they will do, give the freedom to millions, to hundreds of millions of people to do whatever the hell they're gonna do. Can you imagine? Can you just imagine? It's truly, truly exciting. So in that sense, the work you're doing, it's unimaginable the kind of impact it would have. Now, going back to that hard moment, this dark place you went in your mind and your personal life story, you lost your husband. What gave you strength during that time? What were the places you went to your mind in terms of personal struggle, in terms of maybe even depression or these kinds of struggles? I think for me, when my person passed away, I went to, maybe my friends could see what was going on, maybe they couldn't, I don't know. But on the surface, I looked like I was fine. But what happened is the only thing I think that kept me around as I thought about it was the job to be done. These women relied on me and I was no longer free. I did not own myself. And they said it in those words, you don't own yourself anymore. And it was true, but it helped me because I was able to, you know, sometimes whatever it takes to keep you around, whatever it takes. And that's what I would tell people who feel like they can't just push one more push and they think they need to end it. At that point, whatever it takes, just stick around for one more second because the next second, you know. So I stuck around because of duty. I felt a very strong sense of duty. My duty was in this case, I think, stronger than my pain. I don't know how that was possible, but it was. And I just pushed my grief under the rug for years. For years, I worked like a mad lady. I would travel, I would do three states in three days, landing at two in the morning, around five or six going right along with our distributors because it was beverage and just keep going and have all of this energy and look like everything is fine. But what happened was just like, I was focused on the job to be done. And sometimes it is okay to do that. At least for me, it was my safety. You know, like when you're in the water and you're about to sink and they throw you that, that round thing, I don't know how you call it. You know, that, you know. I think that keeps you afloat, you mean? Yes, yes, the floater. It's the floater. Yeah, whatever. Listen, between the two of us, we're still terrible. We're bad. So I said, you, you, you. I know exactly what you mean. Exactly, right? So you understand me. So they send you that thing and you just, I was just hanging onto it. My life depended on this thing. So these women, they carried me. They carried me. And with time, things are moving forward. And at some point I went into really, really deep depression and I went into a very dark place, even darker than the one I think I came from. Because by that time I had worked for years on this company and now some other things was happening. And around that time, it's also when I was discovering a lot of what we talked about today, about what makes a country rich. And for me to understand that my network, I was very much into left oriented network. And to just start to see all of this, I tried to address it to realize that many of these people would prefer go running for the hills than accept for a moment that maybe capitalism might be part of a solution, when many of them were involved in capitalism. So that was a hard time. At some point I was, yeah, so many things were happening around that time that basically shook up everything for me. One, it's hard to talk about because it's very personal and the person that I was having a problem with passed away last year. And I'm one to always say, leave the dead alone. So because of that, I won't speak about it, but there to having a major fallout with somebody who was like a father figure for me, somebody that I completely trusted. And so at some point you just tell, ask yourself, was my whole life built on a lie, right? And then you're confused and then you become confused. And then at some point you lose 90% of your friends because of, ideologically speaking, it doesn't work anymore. Then you just wonder, have I, have I been asleep this whole time? And then you start to wonder, remember when you asked me, who am I? At some point, Lex, I literally was like a candle in the wind. I felt like I was a candle in the wind. And it was very hard to come back from that. And people have a hard, the few people I talk to about this, they have a hardest time understanding or even believing it because they're like, you? I'm like, yes, me. I used to be a candle in the wind. What got you out? What made you overcome that? My current husband. My current husband. Love? Love. See, when I tell you love is the answer. But him, he came with love, but he also came with really helping me figure out the world. So what Michael, because that's him, who we're talking about, Michael Strong. That must be special. He's so special. He's so special. So you have no idea how special he is. But you know, Michael, the reason why I have such love, respect and admiration for my husband, I'll never say it enough, is because actually it's one of those relationships that got built based on intellect first. You see, at some point I was in the position where I could start a foundation after having built my first business. And all I wanted was an ability to power as many, especially women, African women entrepreneurs like me a few years ago, before then, to do something like I was able to do. Bring back to the world some really cool aspects of our culture built into a really cool brand, 21st century type. That's what I wanted to do. Because the more I could promote women like that and put steam behind them, and the more my dream envisioned for a respected Africa, prosperous Africa would happen, back then that's what I wanted. And around me, this was also part of a whole crisis of ideologies I had back then. Everybody was like, well, we should be just doing grants. And I knew that my people didn't need grants. They didn't need like a handout. They don't want your charity. I didn't want charity. I wanted someone who could work with me on my accounting. I wanted somebody who could help me brainstorm marketing wise. I wanted somebody, or I needed to raise money to pay my research and development guy to help me take the juices from my grandma's recipe to something that can be shelf stable. I needed coaching. These are all the things that I needed to make my dream happen. I didn't want you to give me some crap for free. That's not what I want. I just want to be able to build my business with all the things that business building needs. And so that's what I wanted to do and it's what it was needed. And so Michael, somebody found out about what I was doing because back in the days of San Francisco, they would write a lot about me and everything. And so Michael, along with John Mackey, the founder of Whole Foods Market, they had a nonprofit called Flow. And it's all about human flourishing. They want for people, everybody to get this choice, this ability to be able to get to a point in their life where they're in complete flow. It's, Michael, just make high. Michael is the only one who could say that last name. But you know, the whole concept of flow, when you're in a state of flow, you're basically doing what you're supposed to do, the way you're supposed to do it with the people you're supposed to, this whole concept of flow. It's human flourishing at its highest. So, you know, so I meet with this man. Max, you're so, okay, so we, he finds me, his people find me. And then there was a program where it was all about accelerating women entrepreneurs. So it's during this times that I'm starting now to see things. That's when actually all of this stuff that I noticed, how come here it takes me all of this time to start my business, over there it's 20 minutes, here it's free, over there it's thousands of dollars, all of this nonsense that I just took, oh, maybe it's just because we're messed up, we're poor, that's why everything is so messed up. Whoa, these people are introducing me to concepts. I'm like, first of all, I'm like, oh, really? What did you call the doing business in the, what is that? You know, all of this stuff. And I'm starting to discover this whole other body of work. That the free markets, like this thing that I was sensing, this environment that I was sensing that it was different around me. And that they called it the free markets over here. And over there, that. And then I started to butt head those ideas with the ideas that I was fed with before that. And the evidence won. And further more than the evidence, the evidence combined with my lived experience, it was so powerful. So I basically started understanding these ideas from the most visceral part of my body, you know, of my being. And it makes sense. So Michael, Michael helped me find the solution, the answer to my lifelong little girl's question of why do they have this and we don't? And how do some countries like mine be poor while others are rich? And with understanding all of that, the greatest, biggest sense of liberation came upon me. Like, I have no other word to describe that. True liberation, the liberation that comes from a peer to finally understand and be vindicated in your own, you know, understand in your own deep knowing or feeling that they're not, what they're saying is not true. You're not the problem. It's not you. There's something else. And when I discovered that, my whole life changed. So, and since then I have been very serious about going deeper and deeper and deeper into my understanding of all of this, understanding the subtlety. At some point I was very angry about the liberators of Africa, because I was like, yes, you helped liberate us, but just to keep us in this mirrorism, I was angry for longest time. And then eventually you have to engage empathy and love to put yourself in their shoes and try to understand the time at which they were living. And that got me onto a journey of trying to understand history more. That's how I understood I was able to go beyond just these liberators and try to understand and rebuild the world around them at the macro and also at the macro level. Just really, you have to try to walk in their shoes. And from there, finally separate the baby with the bathwater that they were not able to do back then. That's why today, I'm sorry, but I have no patience for the BLM organizers, founders, especially the founders. I don't know what the organizers think, but the founders told us what they stand for. And I say, guys, don't make that same mistake again. If you're serious about this, you cannot make the same mistake. The liberals of Africa, they have an excuse. We didn't know better. It was so easy back then to conflate everything. But today, you, me, anybody alive cannot with a straight face embrace Marxist socialist ideas, especially, especially when they're claiming that they wanted people to thrive. No, you can't, I'm sorry. And I will hold your feet up to the fire on that one. I will, I will. And that's what I'm doing. They will give me a lot of grief for this, but guess what? I could care less. Do you know why I could care less? Because we have an entire population to help rise out of poverty into prosperity, where they become co creators, global co creators of innovation. And those ideas give you hope for the place you love, for Senegal, for Africa. They do. They do. The world I live in, the new centers of culture and fashion are in Dakar. The new centers of tech and, you know, crypto even is somewhere, maybe Nigeria. So you see that future, you see that future clearly. I do, I do, I do. It's a beautiful thing. And it's also beautiful to see that the space of these really powerful ideas is where you also found love. Right? So at the intersection. At the intersection, Michael and I would spend hours talking about all of these ideas. And I would be like, but what about this? No, it doesn't make any sense. No, no, no, oh no. And then hours, every single day for months, Lex. Yeah. And then from there, our love was born. Cause I tell people for us, love is not about looking at each other in the eyes, like, you know, they all think, but it's about, we look in one direction. And in this case, it's this vision, what we know to be possible and true. If only you liberate people. What we know to be true and possible. We, all of us are miracles walking around. Every time I get on a plane, it's a miracle of engineering. All the things we're able to do, you know, now when they do operation on your teeth, how they're able to put the pain down away. All of this is us. You're working on these robots. This, this, this inside here. Humans are amazing. I know. So that's why, and when it works in great tandem with this guy, these two working together. Yeah. Ooh. Watch out. There's nothing we can't accomplish. Nothing, nothing. Well, God, you're one of the most incredible people I've ever talked to. Oh, you say that. You're amazing. You've met everybody. Thank you so much. This is truly an honor. Thank you for everything you're doing. Thank you for the fire that burns within you. And there's just the passion you have for a place that's going to, I think, define the future of humanity. So thank you for everything you're doing. Thank you for talking to me. Thank you. Thank you to you. And sometimes I hope this fire doesn't consume me. That's how much it is. But I am grateful to you for this. And yeah, thank you for, I know you don't do a lot of these, you know, I am, it's this type of interviews. Maybe I don't know, but I'm so, so happy. You mean fun, inspiring, powerful interviews. Yes, I need to do more of that. You're amazing. I don't know, because at first I was like, Lex Friedman, really? Yeah, really? How's this going to go? I'm like, yeah, I'm going to talk to Lex and go all crazy. I think you need to work on your unconscious bias. Right. All right, thank you, Magat. You're the best. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Magat Wade. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, let me leave you with some words from Nelson Mandela. Money won't create success. The freedom to make it will. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time. But then even about the place, you're thinking, again, two countries, different backgrounds, same outcome, same background, different outcome. What is this? And then I go on. I start, I am in Silicon Valley in the late 90s, early 2000s, that come boom, all of that. And I'm starting to discover this concept of this thing called entrepreneurship. You know, I'm in Silicon Valley and just getting to experience what seems so cliche by now, but you know, people getting together in the back of a napkin, talking about an idea, putting it out, and then they go out and they talk to some of these investors who's gonna invest in it. Then they have the lawyers who get to put all of this stuff together. And then they have the big four CPA firms, this whole ecosystem of what they call entrepreneurship. And then eventually this concept of entrepreneurship being this idea of creating something out of nothing. So there I am. And at some point I become an entrepreneur myself. And the way I became an entrepreneur was not like, I woke up and I'm like, I wanna make money, so I'm gonna become an entrepreneur. No, and this is also another problem I have with people who have a problem with entrepreneurs or business people. Most entrepreneurs do not start a business to become rich. Most entrepreneurs start a business because they have found, identified a problem that bothered them enough, that they said, enough is enough. I'm gonna do something about it. What entrepreneurs are are people who criticize by creating. Do they always get it right? No, as a matter of fact, the failure in entrepreneurship is humongous. It's kamikaze path to take the entrepreneurship path. We lose our spouses. My first husband passed away as soon as I was about to sign my first term sheet. And yet I had to keep going. What force can keep you going after you just lost the love of your life? What force keeps you going? The force of, oh, I just wanna be rich, really? When your whole world is upside down, your whole world is upside down and you just want to quit. You just want to go meet him and join him in death. I stayed, why? Because of the same reason why I started my company. I stayed because of the women whom I had put back to work by then. We're talking about some of the most vulnerable women in my country. These are women who grow the hibiscus, which we need to make the bisap, which is the juice of taranga, remember? This is our national identity drink. And for the longest time, women grow this hibiscus that we use for the national drink, for this drink. And now that Coca Cola, Pepsi, and all that had made it through the marketing that it is more cool to drink those beverages, now there is no more market for the hibiscus. And with that goes the livelihoods of these women. And for me, that bothered me enough because in that force, I saw two things. One was a part of my culture. We're talking about, I mean, part of my cultural identity, for Christ's sake, the juice of taranga. You asked me, what defines you? I said, taranga, there's a juice for it. So my culture is disappearing. And at the same time, these women are sliding into abject poverty because what they used to make no one needs anymore. So that is what got me to start a company. And the company was created just because of that. I wanted to build a company that would allow me to not only preserve this very important aspect of my cultural identity, and at the same time, put these women back to work. And maybe it's more difficult to put into words, but there's a kind of, it's a basic human spirit where you see the place where you came from breaking apart in some kind of way, and you have the entrepreneurial fire that dreams of helping. Yes. And that, sometimes it's hard to convert that into words. You have to tell nice stories and so on, but it's the basic human desire to help. Yes. And like I said, criticized by creating. Especially when you've been, especially when, and let's face it, do we all, are we all a bundle of circumstances, some happy, some worse? Yes, we are. And oftentimes I ask myself, my God, why you? Why did you get to have the opportunities that you have? What makes you different from, let's say, even your cousin that couldn't, that is still home, trapped? Because we call ourselves trapped citizens. When you're trapped in these countries that go nowhere, we're like a bunch of trapped citizens. So you see, Lex, when my husband passed away and I wanted nothing more to do than to quit and to send, investors had already said, we understand if you want to stop. Whatever you decide to do, we'll do that. And I wanted to quit and I was actually on my way. I was in Senegal for a month, trying to really get a bearing over myself. And by the end of the month, I had decided I'm letting go. There's no way. The pain was too great, nothing made sense anymore. It was too much. So I went to see this woman and I talked to the one who, you know, we're talking back then, there were 400 of them, later on we grew to 9,000. And I told the representative of all of them, and I told her, this is very, this is her old lady. And just looking at her, I knew I was going through some pain, but this woman has probably gone through 10 times, not that pain is, you know, like measurable, but you could tell this woman probably lost a child as oftentimes happen in places, you know, that are lower income countries. Probably lost a husband also, probably who knows, so many people, loss is part of our lives. You can see the pain. You can see the pain, yet she's so, so dignified. She's so dignified. And that already kind of made me like, my God, stop crying. But, and I told her that I was quitting. I could not look her in the eyes. And she said, look at me. I could not look her in the eyes. She said, look at me, child. And I looked at her and she said, you know, I know you're in pain, but where your husband is, where your beloved is, is absolutely nothing that you can do for him. But for us, you can change everything. And I went back. So that's what entrepreneurs are at their best. Did she help you find your strength? Yes, and I was weak still, but I said, you put that aside. There's a job to do here. And I went back and I fought with everything that I had. And this company that I started in my kitchen became this company that had the who's who of the beverage world, with at some point, Roger Enrico, the chairman of PepsiCo sitting on my board. And yeah, I went back because of that. So the reason why I tell this story for me is important because the world needs to understand that there is a viable way of caring and of being part of a solution for the lesser fortunate in terms of not keeping them where they are and we're like the saviors coming and giving them food and all that. No, no, no, no, no. But it's just like the leg up I got in my life. Give somebody else a leg up. What are the things you're fighting against in Africa when you try to build a business like that? So then we're building this company. And back then, this was in 2004 that was when I built my first company. We had to have two sister companies, one there, one here. So the one in Africa was about the whole supply chain. And the one in America was research and development, sales and marketing, all of that good stuff. And then at some point I look around, I'm like, wait a second. Here, back in the days before we had the, they would talk, they would say, oh, we have this one stop shop for business registration. But the truth is very quickly you can set up an LLC in the US. We're talking about less than, even then less than, today it's super fast, 20 minutes online, done. Back then it was less than few hours to get it done, cost you almost nothing. We're talking about a few hundred dollars, three, two to 350 depending which state you are. So LLC, starting a basic company takes almost no time. No time, no time, no money, almost. You don't have to know a guy that knows a guy that slipped some money to the politician and so on. No, none of that stuff, none of that stuff. And so at the same time, also things like, and this I can take you even to today's day. Okay, Lex, I don't know if you have employees on payroll or anything like that, but do you have to go every month or anybody listening to us right now, do they have to go every single month to three different type of agencies, like governmental agencies to do one step? This one is basically you're gonna go and give them your retirement money, like the pension part of the salary that you took out from your employee. You have to go to this agency and put that application through. So you leave that money behind, then you go to another agency. This one is for the health, care, whatever. You have three of those places where you have to literally go to in person, three times, three places every single month to drop off these paperwork. Do you have to do that anywhere in the US? I mean, do we have that situation anywhere that you know of right now? No, no. And do you think that's a business friendly or do you think it's cumbersome in business? And that's not just cumbersome sort of physically, it's cumbersome psychologically, that there's a feeling like the system around you, yeah, there's a feeling like you're trapped. It's a feeling like the system doesn't want you to succeed versus a system that does want you to succeed. Exactly. You're in a country like we're in Texas. If you make less than a million bucks in revenues a year, all you do, five minutes it takes you, you're filing your franchise tax, that's it. It's below that number, tell them what it is, then you have nothing to give them or anything like that, you move on. Us, even if I make this much, there is a minimum tax that you have to pay, which is $1,000 in Senegal right now. For the listener, my guy was holding up a zero. You make no money. You still have to pay. You still have to pay. And then, oh, let me walk you through what happened to me when we had to try to get the electricity hooked up on our first office. So we go, they say, oh, first you have to apply, you know, like you normally you have to apply. Then we apply, we pay the money. Remember again, here you have to also go, this was like, you know, you go to the office and you pay. And then we wait, and we wait, and we wait. And when I say we wait, I'm not talking about we waited 24 hours, we waited 48 hours. A month, two months, three months, four months, five months, you go, you send your assistant, she goes, she comes back. Well, they say we send it to wait. At some point I'm like, I gotta go there. So I go there and I asked to speak to the head of the district for, you know, and I'm just like going on and on and on and on about how we've been delayed. This is gonna be a problem. We have to produce, everything is delayed. And I risk losing my business. We already presold some of these products to our customers. I gotta, something needs to happen. So at some point the gentleman looks at me, he's like, lady, look over there. I look over there, I see a pile of paper this high. We're talking about maybe hundreds of applications. Each one of them is a single sheet. Each single sheet is an application for getting the electricity. And he says, do you see that? I said, yeah. And he said, look over there. I look over there to the other side. I see two meters. He's like, each of these applications needs one of those. How many do you see? I said, two. Then I knew I was in trouble. And then I said, what do I do? And he said, lady, it's not at our level. And I agreed with him. It was not on his level. But eventually, by now you can tell that I pretty much get what I need because, and at that point what I did was not threaten him or anything like that. I didn't even pay a bribe or anything, but you could see why people pay bribes. Because when you have a pile like that, then the only way to advance your file, and that by the way happens even at the passport office. You come, you apply for your passport, which is your right. They forced us to have passports. It's your right as a citizen to have a passport. And even there, if you want yours to keep going through the process, you have to bribe somebody so it can go even the pace it's supposed to go, let alone faster. So here, I'm thinking I have a problem. And at that point, I did what I do. I talked to him about all the things I was trying to do. I explained to him why I'm here, why I'm trying to do this. And even him said, lady, someone like you, you have no reason to even be here. You could be back in America, living your life, la vida loca, you don't have to be here. So that I think gained a lot of his respect. And I said, if you don't do, if you don't help me with this, I understand I shouldn't be of a priority or anything like that, but I beg you, I beg of you. I need for this to go on this week. And he said, okay, that's how I got my meter. One of those two meters became mine. So then he said, but we have a problem. And I said, what? He said, well, the truck, we need a truck to be here to do it because of where you are from the poll, we need long cable lines to get it all done. But the truck is, I don't know, I don't know where the truck was because they had this one truck for I don't know how many customers. So I go to the mayor of a town with whom I'm quite friends, but you see, I know people, but it shouldn't be this way. So I go to the mayor of a town and I said, mayor, he happens to have the same name as me, first, last name, same, but except he's the ugly one, I'm the pretty one because, you know, he's, you know. That's so people can tell you apart, she's the pretty one. Exactly, I'm the pretty one and he's the whatever. So I got to the mayor and I'm like, mayor, I need your help, you need to help me with this. He's like, now what? And I explained to him and he's like, okay, you can take the truck from the city hall. I'll tell the guys that they can allow you to have it. And then they come and then you guys can do this. And then we arrived there. Guess what? I thought I was done, Lex, but I was not done. Because now the electricity company, by the way, whom we paid, everything was there. They've been sitting on our money for nine months by now. Well, we need a ladder long enough to, you know, like one of the super, super professional ladders that normally the electricity companies have. Theirs was in some other village and they didn't know if it was going to be back for another three days or four days. I said, are you kidding me? He's like, no. So I call mayor again. I'm just like, mayor, do you have a ladder? And I explained and he said, and that's how I got my electricity hooked up. Otherwise I probably would still be waiting. So Lex, you add all of these things together. And also the fact that in my country, by the way, the labor laws are so stringent. Basically you are married to employees for good or for bad. And some people say, oh no, you're not married for good or for bad, except that it will just cost you a lot of time and money to get rid of any of them. It doesn't matter the circumstances. Do you think I really, an entrepreneur really need to hear something like that? You know, the head of the ILO, I had an argument with him at the UN. And I said to him, listen, and you listened to me very well. The reason, if you want to protect employees, as you claim, everything you're doing is to protect employees. A, you know better of a human being than I am in terms of wanting to make sure that people are treated right and fairly. But last time I checked, Google, for example, is not offering their employees chef cooked meals, super healthy, anything they want, feeding them from morning till evening, having some babysitters, having childcare on site, all of these perks that come on top of really cozy salaries. It did not happen because you, the ILO, told them, you have to do this. It happened because there are enough jobs created around that now you're in an employee's market and employers have to fall all over themselves to attract the best talent among us. That's how it's done. And not with your nonsense that you're imposing me right now, which the only results you're gonna get, like in my country, do you know what we have to show for all of these, the fact that the Senegalese employees, the most protected employee on paper in the world? Well, we're one of the 25 poorest countries in the world. That's what it got us. So let's try to just untangle this. So there's a system in place. There's a momentum with that system. Like you said, ladies, it's not my level, which is for somebody who grew up in the Soviet Union, at least echoes some of the same sounds I heard from people I knew there. It's kind of this helpless feeling like, well, this is just part of the system, this gigantic bureaucracy. And the corruption that happens is just like the only way to get around, to get anything done. And so the corruption grows. Maybe could you speak to the corruption? Is there, to what degree is there corruption in Senegal and Africa, and how do we fix it? So when you said to which degrees there is corruption, I will respond to you the same I respond to people. I say, yeah, we have corruption, and it's almost as bad as in Chicago, right? So now what I want people to understand when it comes to corruption, it's because we are misguided with corruption. We think corruption is the root cause of problems. When corruption is simply a symptom of the deeper root problem. In this case, if you make the laws so senseless, meaning, let me give you an example of senseless laws. Every time I have to import something in my country, I have a business, we're making lip balms in this case\n",

      "Text: If this is a super intelligence, if it's folding proteins and analyzing like all data sets and all whatever they give it access to, how can we be certain that it's not gonna figure out how to get itself out of the cloud, how to store itself in other like mediums, trees, the optic nerve, the brain, you know what I mean? We don't know that. We don't know that it won't leap out and like start hanging. Like, and then at that point, now we do have the wildfire. Now you can't stop it, you can't unplug it. You can't shut your servers down because it left the box, left the room using some technology you haven't even discovered yet. How fucking cool would that be for like the men in black to come to me like, listen, I need you to infiltrate the fucking comedy scene. The following is a conversation with Duncan Trussell, a standup comedian, host of the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast and one of my favorite human beings. I've been a fan of his for many years. So it was a huge honor and pleasure to meet him for the first time and to sit down for this chat. This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Duncan Trussell. Nietzsche has this thought experiment called eternal recurrence, where you get to relive your whole life over and over and over and over. And I think it's a way to bring to the surface of your mind the idea that every single moment in your life matters. It intensely matters, the bad and the good. And he kind of wants you to imagine that idea that every single decision you make throughout your life, you repeat over and over and over, and he wants you to respond to that. Do you feel horrible about that or do you feel good about that? And you have to think through this idea in order to see where you stand in life. What is your relationship like with life? I actually wanna read the way he first introduces that concept for people who are not familiar. What if some day or night a demon, by the way, he has a demon introduce this thought experiment. What if some day or night a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you, quote, this life as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more. And innumerable times more. And there will be nothing new in it. But every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh and everything unutterably small and great in your life will have to return to you, all in the same succession and sequence. Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment when you would have answered him, you are a God and never have I heard anything more divine. So are you terrified or excited by such a thought experiment when you apply it to your own life? Excited. Excited. Oh. Even the dark stuff. Oh yeah, for sure. Definitely. I mean, also that thing you're talking about, he kind of leaves out maybe on purpose because the thought experiment starts falling apart a little bit. Yeah. The amnesia between each loop. So the whole thing gets wiped. Now, if the amnesia wasn't there and yet somehow you are witnessing the non autonomy implicit in what he's talking about, so you have to kind of watch yourself go through this rotten loop, then yeah, that's a description. There's probably a boredom that comes into that. So you don't experience everything anew. Exactly. So the bad stuff, the good stuff, the newness of it is really important. That's it, yeah. This is the, in Hades, when you die, there's a river, I think it's called Leith. You ever heard of this? L E T H E. You drink from it and you don't remember your past lives. And then when you're reborn, it's fresh and you don't have to, I mean, just think of like the amount of psychological help you would need to get over all the bullshit that happened in prior lives. You know what I mean? Can you imagine if you're still resentful of something someone did to you in the 14th century, but it would compound. Well, if you repeat the same thing over and over and over, there would be no difference. Maybe you would start to appreciate the nuances more, like when you watch the same movie over and over and over, maybe you'll get to actually let go of this idea of all the possible, all the positive possibilities that lay before you, but actually enjoy the moment much more. If you remember that you've lived this life a thousand times, all the little things, the way somebody smiles, if you're been abused, the way somebody, like the pain of it, the suffering, the down that you feel, the experience of sadness, depression, fear, all that kind of stuff. You get to really, you get to also appreciate that that's part of life, part of being alive. Now, also in his experiment, if I was gonna, and I love the experiment from the perspective of like, just where technology is now and simulation theory and stuff like that. But in that thought experiment, if this rotten demon immediately killed you, then within that, it's a little more horrifying because even in the, first of all, you're trusting a fucking demon. Why are you talking to a demon? Let's start there. Yeah, because that is gonna be, even before I get into like the metaphysics and like the implications and where is this life stored? Where's the loop stored? I mean, are we talking about some kind of unchanging data set or something? For that, you're like, why is there a fucking talking demon in my room trying to freak me out? You're gonna wanna autopsy the demon. Can you catch it? Does this apply to you, demon? And again, obviously it's a fucking thought experiment. Nietzsche would be annoyed by me, but I think like you would still be able to entertain the joy, you'd have the joy of not knowing what's around the corner. You know, still, it's not like you know what's coming just cause the demon said some kind of loop. In other words, the idea of being damned to your past decisions, it doesn't even work because you can't remember what decisions you're about to make. So from that perspective also, I think I'd be happy about it. Or I would just think, oh cool. I mean, it's a good story. I'm gonna tell people about how this. I wonder what the demon would actually look like in real life cause I suspect that would look like a charming, like a friend. Wouldn't they be a loved one? Wouldn't the demon come to you through the mechanism, through the front door of love, not through the back door of evil, like malevolent manipulation? Sure, I mean, if it's the truth, if it's the truth and that's whether it's love or not, it's still good fundamentally. I do like the idea of the memory replay. I remember I went to a Newer Link event a few years ago and got to hang out with Elon. I remember how visceral it is that there's like a pig with a Newer Link in it. And you're talking about memory replays as a future, maybe far future possibility. And you realize, well, this is a very meaningful moment in my life. This could be a replay. Of all the things you replay, it's probably, there's certain magical moments in your life. Whatever it is, certain people you've met for the first time or certain things you've done for the first time with certain people or just an awesome thing you did. And I remember just saying to him, like, I would probably want to replay this, this moment. And it just seemed very kind of, I mean, there was a recursive nature to it, but it seemed very real that this is something we would want to do, that the richness of life could be experienced through the replay. That's probably where it's experienced the most. You could see life as a way to collect a bunch of cool memories, and then you get to sit back in your nice VR headset and replay the cool ones. That's right. This is, in Buddhism, the idea that I struggle with is that there's a possibility of not reincarnating, of not coming back. That's the idea. This is suffering here. The suffering is caused by attachment. And so if you like revise the idea of reincarnation or the Nietzsche's loop and look at it from, could this be possible? Or how would this be possible technologically? Then to me, it makes a lot of sense. Like I've been thinking a lot about this very thing and the Nietzsche's idea connecting to it. I had this like, it sounds so dumb, but I was at the dentist getting nitrous oxide, high as a fucking kite, man. And I had this idea, I was thinking about data. I was thinking like, man, probably, if I had to bet, there's some energetic form that we're not aware of that for a super advanced technology would be as detectable as like starlight, but something that we just don't even know what it is. Quantum turbulence, who the fuck knows? Fill in the blank, whatever that X may be. But assuming that exists, that somehow data, even the most subtle things, the tiniest movements, whatever it may be, the emanations of your neurological process energetically, whatever it may be, is radiating out in the space time, then what if like the James Webb version of this for some advanced civilization is not that they're like looking at the nebula or whatever, but they're actually able to peer into the past and via some bizarre technology recreate whatever life, simulate whatever life was happening there just by decoding that quantum energy, whatever it is. I'm only saying quantum because it's what dumb people say when they don't know. You just say quantum, I don't know. But you know what I mean? You're decoding that. So meaning, in simulation theory, one of the big questions that pops up is why and are we in one? And Elon has talked about, well, it's probably more of a probability than we're in one than we're not, in which case, what you're talking about is actually happening, that that loop you're talking about, we've decided to be here. This, of all the things, we decided this one, oh, let's do that one again. I wanna do that one. Let's try, let's do that. I love thinking about this because I love my family. And it makes sense to me that if I'm going to replay some life or another, it's definitely gonna be this one with my kids, my wife, with all the bullshit that's gone along with it, I'm still gonna wanna come back. So in Buddhism, that's attachment. Yeah, but you weren't the one, oh, you're saying that you're the main player, you're not the NPC. Well, I think we're dealing with all NPCs at this point. I mean, depending on how you wanna, like very, I would say very advanced NPCs, like incredibly advanced NPCs compared to Fallout or something. We've got a lot of conversation options happening here. There's not like four things you can pick from. Yeah, there's a whole illusion of free will that's happening. We really do, depending where you are in the world, feel like you're free to decide any trajectory in your life that you want. Which is pretty funny, right? For an NPC, it's pretty, it's nice. Well, you're gonna want that. If we're making a video game, you do wanna give your NPCs the illusion of free will because it's gonna make interactions with them that much more intense. Yeah, so I wonder on the path to that, how hard is it to create, this is sort of the Carmack question of a realistic virtual world that's as cool as this one. Not fully realistic, but sufficiently realistic that it's as interesting to live in. Because we're gonna have to create those worlds on the path to creating something like a simulation. Like long, long, long before. It'd be virtual worlds where we'd wanna stay forever because they're full of that balance of suffering and joy, of limitations and freedoms and all that kind of stuff. A lot of people think like in the virtual world, I can't wait to be able to, I don't know, have sex with anybody I want or have anything I want. But I think that's not gonna be fun. You want the limitations, the constraints. So you have to battle for the things you want. Okay, but, okay, but great video games. One of my favorite video game memories was like I started playing World of Warcraft in its original incarnation. And I didn't even know that you were gonna have flying mounts. Like I didn't even know. So I've been running around dealing with all the encumbrances of like being an undead warlock that can't fly. But then all of a sudden, holy shit, there's flying mounts. And now the world you've been running around not flying, you're seeing it from the top down. It was just really cool. Like, whoa, I could do this now. And then that gets boring. But a really well designed game, it has a series of these, I don't know what you call it, extra abilities that kind of unfold and produce novelty. And then eventually you just accept it, you take it for granted. And then another novelty appears. Those extra abilities are always balanced with the limitations, the constraints they run up against. Because a well balanced video game, the challenge, the struggle matches the new ability. Yeah, and sometimes causes problems on its own. I mean, and so to go back to this universe, this simulation, it's really designed like a pretty awesome video game. If you look at it from the perspective of history, I mean, people were on horses. They didn't know that they were gonna be bullet trains. They didn't know that you could get in a car and drive across the country in a few days. That would have sounded ridiculous. We're doing that now. And even in our own lifespan, think about it. How long has VR goggles existed? Like the ones that you could just buy at Best Buy. I had the original Oculus Rift, the fucking puke machine. You put that thing on, I gave it to my friend. He went and vomited in my driveway and people were making fun of it. They were saying, this isn't gonna catch on. It's too big, it's unwieldy, the graphics suck. And then look at where it's at now. And that's going to keep, that trajectory is gonna keep improving. So yeah, I think that we are dealing with what you're talking about, which is novelty met with more problems, met with novelty. Yeah, I wonder why VR is not more popular. I wonder what is going to be the magic thing that really convinces a large fraction of the world to move into the virtual world. I suppose we're already there in the 2D screen of Twitter and social media and that kind of stuff. And even video games, there's a lot of people that get a big sense of community from video games. But like, it doesn't feel like you're living there. It's like, bye mom, I'm going to this other world. Or like you leave your girlfriend to go get your digital girlfriend. That's gonna be a problem. There's less jealousy in the digital world. Maybe there should be a lot of jealousy in the digital world. Cause that's jealousy, a little jealousy is probably good for relationships, even in the digital world. So you're gonna have to simulate all of that kind of stuff. But I wonder what the magic thing that says, I wanna spend most of my days inside the virtual world. Well, clearly it's gonna be something we don't have yet. I mean, strapping that damn thing on your face still feels weird. It's heavy. If you're depending on what gear you're using, sometimes light can leak in. There's just, you gotta recharge it. It's hyper limited. And then, so yeah, it's gonna have to be something that like simulates taste, smell. You think taste and smell are important touch? I do, yeah. I can't just do, in World War II, you would write letters. You could still, don't you think you can convey love with just words? For sure. But I think for what you're talking about to happen, it has to be fully immersive. So that it's not that you feel like you're walking cause it looks like you're walking, but that your brain is sending signals telling your body that you're walking, that you feel the wind blowing in your face, not because of some, I don't know, fan or something that it's connected to, but because somehow it's figured out how to hack into the human brain and send those signals minus some external thing. Once that happens, I'd say we're gonna see a complete radical shift in everything. See, I disagree with you. I don't know if you've seen the movie Her. Yeah. I think you can go to another world in where a digital being lives in the darkness and all you hear is Scarlett Johansson voice talking to you and she lives there or he lives there, your friend, your loved one, and all you have is voice and words. And I think that could be sufficient to pull you into that world where you look forward to that moment all day. You never wanna leave the darkness, just closing your eyes and listening to the voice. I think those basic mediums of communication is still enough. Like language is really, really powerful. And I think the realism of touch and smell and all that kind of stuff is not nearly as powerful as language. That's what makes humans really special is our ability to communicate with each other. That's the sense of like deep connection we get is through communication. Now that communication could involve touch. Like, you know, hugging feels damn good. You see a good friend, you hug. That's one of the big things with doing COVID with Rogan. When you see him, there's a giant hug coming your way and that makes you feel like, yeah, this feels great. But I think that can be just with language. I think for a lot of people that's true, but we're talking like massive adoption of a technology by the world. And if language was just enough, we wouldn't be selling TVs. People will be reading. They wanna watch, they wanna see, you know? But I agree with you, man. When you're getting absorbed into a book and especially if you've got, I think a lot of us went through a weird dark ages when it came to reading. Like when I was a kid and there wasn't the option for these hypno rectangles, that's just what you did. There wasn't even anything special about it. What's a hypno rectangle? Your phone. You know, it was like, you didn't, when that gravity well. Hypno rectangle, gravity well. It is. Attention, gravity well, yeah. When we weren't feeling the pull of these things all the time, you would just read and you weren't patting yourself on the back about reading. You just, that's what you had. You had that and you had like eight channels on the TV and a shitty VCR. So, you know, then a lot of people stop reading because of these things, you know, or they think they're reading because they are technically reading, but you know, when you return to reading after a pause, whoa, and you realize how powerful this simulator is when it's given the right code of language, whoa, holy shit, it's incredible. I mean, it's like, again, it's the most embarrassing which is you can end up like missing a lot of moments. You could, or you start doing the old kick the can down the road thing where you're like coming up with a variety of ways to procrastinate, making it work now, because you know, this fucking human lifespan idea, man, it's really caused a lot of problems. When they started saying on average, this is how many years you're gonna live if you're a human being, man, that is like really bad because a lot of people hear that and they like feel like that's a guaranteed number of years in some temporal bank that they have access to. And when you get cancer, that's like when you get the alert on your phone where you're like, what the fuck? Wait, what? Like, oh shit, like I have like, either I don't know how much money's in that bank account or I have way less than I thought. And so at that point, you get to be in the truth because that's ultimately, I think that's what it feels like. It feels like truth. It's truth. It's the truth. It's the truth. Like the whole bubble of ignorance that you subconsciously built around yourself to avoid experiencing the terror of your own mortality, just, it's like a meteorite in the form of your doctor talking to you just shatters that thing. And now you're like, especially with eye testicular cancer. So when you get the diagnosis, it's just like the movies. The mother, the doctor took me in his office and you just know, I got cancer. It's like, you don't even have to say. It's like, I know what you're about to say. I'm in the office. I know how this goes. But you go in there and what you were thinking, oh, you know, probably just have some weird thing in my ball. That's why it's swollen up like that. Anytime I've gone to the doctor, you always leave like, oh, cool, I'm fine. But no, that's not how you're gonna leave the doctor. You're gonna leave the doctor in a completely different universe than the one you grew up in. You're gonna go from, talk about multiverse. You just popped into a brand new multiverse. So. What was the conversation with the doctor like? Was there like, from a perspective of a doctor, boys had a hard conversation. I feel like you need to build up philosophically to that conversation. Oh no. Oh no, there's not time. He's busy. He's got other appointments, you know. Also, if you're gonna get cancer, testicular cancer is, you know, not that there is a great cancer to get, but that's the, you know, that's a good one because it moves slowly. The treatments they have for it are really advanced now. And so if you catch it early, then, you know, generally it's good, you can survive it. So. So he could offer at least some glimmer of hope. Yeah, yeah, exactly. I mean, you know, but he didn't really do, he couldn't really offer that hope because we had to find out how far the cancer progressed in my body. That's the next step is like, as soon as they tell you you have cancer, they don't, they're not, they move quick. They're like, you know, we're going to schedule the surgery for, I think this was a Thursday or Friday. They're like, we're gonna schedule it for Tuesday. Here's the chance, here's, we don't know for sure it's cancer. That's what they say. It's like, there's a 80 or 90% chance that this is cancer. There is some possibility it could be something else. The only way we can now is like doing a biopsy. And the only way that we can get that biopsy is by cutting one of your balls off. He didn't say it like that, but you know, that's pretty much the logic behind it. It's like, we got to get this thing. It's like a zombie bite. We got to hack this fucking thing off and we got to do it fast. But did you say it in a way that you understood? Yeah, what they do is because they know that when someone gets a cancer diagnosis, that their ability to comprehend information changes. When you get a cancer diagnosis, you, all the tropes, they happen. You're hearing it's weird. You're basically having like an anxiety attack, if I had to guess. It's like a hardcore anxiety attack. And then, you know, a nurse is there with me as he's explaining it. And then her job is, even though he's telling me how to get to the machine that's going to scan my body to see if it's gotten into my brain, he knows I'm not going to remember that. And so this nurse, when you're in this like fog, takes you, at least took me to the machine that does the scan, but you're not going to get that data back for a few days. And so that's where you really live in the real world. That's the real world. It's such a fascinating moment and the days that follow and even that moment, because that doctor, you know, you talk about the matrix where like the pills and so on, you get the blue pill and the red pill. Yeah. This is like the, like the real world introduction, the human introduction is the truth. You've now just taken the red pill. You get to see the truth of reality. And here's a busy doctor just telling you. Yeah. Like all those dreams you've had, all those illusions you've built up to somehow your work as a comedian and actor will make you live forever somehow. It's just the basic illusion we have that we're, this whole project is going to be an infinite sequence of fun things that we're going to get to do. It's like, holy shit, it's not. That's right. It's old. That's right. And there's very sophisticated ways of doing that. And there's very dumb ways of doing that. And I'd really been doing a dumb way of doing that. Like I'd been playing around with this idiot notion of subjective consciousness. So like, I'd been sort of kicking around this, like I think they call it solipsism. It's like, you're like, okay, I know I'm self aware, but no one else can prove that they're self aware. Like I don't, I have no way of proving that everything around me isn't just a video game, isn't just some projection, isn't, you know, who knows what. So maybe everybody else dies. They're NPCs, but I don't, because I'm the only thing I know that has subjective consciousness. Now, it's not like I really believed that. It's like an idea you toy around with when you're trying to evade confronting the reality of your own mortality. It's just the brain will produce all kinds of ridiculous forms of ignorance. And that was one I'd been playing around with. Oh, you mean for like a large part of your life you were playing around with that? Well, not like really, I think it's important to really emphasize, I didn't think I was a mortal. Like I knew at some level, I'm probably gonna die. Everyone dies. But there's ways that you can sort of poke around with that idea. I still do it to this day. Like I still do it. Like it's a natural thing to do when you're confronted with that, with annihilation. You wanna way out. You wanna talk your way out, figure it out. There's gotta be some way to fix it. Well, they'll fix it. That's another thing people do. Well, they'll fix it. Yeah, it'd be fine. They'll expand the human lifespan. That's what they'll do. I mean, that's a big argument for it is like, look, the human lifespan up until COVID, which they had to recalculate like the lifespan because of the statistically all the people who died, it like threw it off a little bit. But pandemics aside, the idea was the human lifespan seemed to be increasing by half a year every year, something like that. We were living longer. So all you gotta do, one more half a year. And we're immortal, right? If we live a year longer every year, then we live forever. And so that's another way you can get out of confronting death is you can think, well, maybe right now we don't have the tech, but it's coming. Consciousness uploads or downloads or whatever, depending on how you wanna look at it. Another way people try to squirm out of the reality of death. There's all kinds of tricks. Yeah, and we do all of them. And sometimes, yeah, I mean, a lot of religions provide different, even more tools in the toolkit for coming up with ideas of how you can live in the illusion that we're not going to, there's not an end to this particular experience that we're having here on earth right now. And then when you get that cancer diagnosis, it's like, yeah, what was that like going home? The car ride, did you drive home alone? Yeah, I mean, it was one of the most. What'd you listen to, Bruce Springsteen? Bruce Springsteen, hey little girl, is your daddy home? That's not a good one to listen to. Does he have cancer, is he gonna die? Yeah, all the love songs. Maybe you experienced them more intensely. I don't remember what I listened to, and I don't remember driving home, but I do remember driving to another doctor appointment, doctor's appointment the next day. I think it was the next day. I think the Goodyear blimp was floating in the sky and I was looking, I was at a stoplight, looking around. Is that God? Is the person flying it know how to cure cancer? Oh, you were looking, oh wow. No, I didn't think that. What I thought was this shit just keeps going. That's what I thought. I thought, I'm gonna be gone and this is just gonna keep going. And that was a beautiful moment for me. It was this beautiful moment of like. You were able to accept it? Oh yeah. No, like that's just what you're talking about with the Ukraine, what you're talking about. It's like, unless you've been there, it's really hard to explain to people that even in the midst of what is generally accepted as one of the worst fucking things that could happen to you, war, cancer, somehow there's still joy. There's still love. There's still, in fact, more. It's almost like when the anesthesia wears off, when you get your mouth worked on, you start feeling again. You're feeling, you're noticing and that, wow. But yet, thank goodness. I think there's other ways for us to achieve this state of consciousness that don't involve war or cancer. Thank God. You think just meditating on your mortality is one such mechanism? Just simply just not allowing yourself to get lost in the day to day illusion of life. Just kind of stopping, putting on Bruce Springsteen. The most spiritual, he is great. Maybe Johnny Cash hurt. Maybe that one. I like Bruce Springsteen. I am knocking Bruce Springsteen. I have a lot of great Bruce Springsteen memories, truly. His music's fantastic. Yeah, but not meditating on mortality to Bruce Springsteen. You know what? I'm just trying to do an audio soundtrack in my head. I guess we can each have our own audio soundtrack. Oh, I'm on fire. It's so good. Yeah, it's a good song. That's one of them. I lay with the sheets soaking wet and the freight train running through the middle of my head and only you can cool my desire. And he's singing about someone else's girl. What a fucking nightmare. Bruce Springsteen's laying in bed with a freight train running through his head thinking about banging your wife and you're out of town. Oh my God. Oh, you're taking the other guy's perspective. Like, holy shit, this guy's gonna get my wife. It's Bruce, yeah, you gotta take the other guy's. But it's love. Both perspectives. I'm sure Bruce Springsteen thought it was love when he's sweating in bed, waiting to go to somebody's house. She does too. What, does that marry? If he's gonna break up that marriage, that marriage wasn't strong enough, right? I mean, that relationship, I mean, that's the way of love. What marriage could survive? Bruce Springsteen. Sweaty Bruce Springsteen. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Well, maybe one that's based on financial, sort of financial dynamics versus like love and sweaty Bruce Springsteen, like romantic connections. Because there's like a music video of that where he's like a mechanic, I think. So he's like the poor mechanic who falls in love with this girl and there's that magic. I've seen that magic. You connect with people like, I'll see somebody, I think Jack Kerouac has that where he meets this Mexican girl on a bus. And like he talks about that heartbreak you feel when you realize this person you just fell in love with in a split second is heading somewhere else in this too big world. But then he actually realizes in, spoiler alert for On The Road, that they're actually heading the same way and he now builds up the courage to talk to her and they kind of fall in love for a few days. And then he realized, eventually realizes that she may not be the perfect person for him. And all the jealousies comes out. It's like, why is this beautiful girl talking to me at all? And then she's probably some kind of, I mean, and that's, it's not very politically correct but he basically thinks that she's a prostitute and he talks to her about like, who's your pimp and all that kind of stuff. He attacks her in all that kind of way when she's just an innocent, she has a past of that kind. But she's an innocent person and they connected and they fell in love with each other. Her gentleness, his worldliness, all that kind of stuff. But that sometimes it doesn't work out that way and there's that heartbreak when you see, you realize you're never gonna be able to have that. And that's, Bruce Springsteen saw that. This is a married woman. I'm never gonna be able to have that, but I want that. And that's the heartbreak. I gotta say, I just assumed they were fucking, like I didn't. I mean, after the song, like if the song doesn't get to. Hey little girl, is your daddy home? Did he go away and leave you all alone? You know, he's like, he knows she's at home alone. Yeah, but it never materializes. He's, it's longing. It's a man who's not with the thing he craves for. So he's longing for, he's talking about the longing. Right. Not with the having. Hey, if anybody in the CIA is watching this, can you look into Bruce Springsteen's file and let us know if he actually banged the person you wrote that song about? What happens after the song, or between the song? We want facts. Look, the longing though, I'll tell you this. Here's what's interesting about that thing that you're talking about. Have you ever heard of something called Bhakti Yoga? I think so, yeah. It's the yoga of love. And there's all kinds, there's forms of it. The most, the one people know about the most is the Hare Krishnas. But the Hare Krishnas are like, you know, the way in Christianity, you've got the Episcopalians, the Catholics, the Baptists. In Bhakti Yoga, you have various deities that are the object of love. And so Bhakti Yoga is like, and what's really cool about it is it's an analysis of love. And so, and it's the supposition being like, love is the way to commune with the divine. Now, a distinction is drawn between like two big worldviews that are spiritual. One is the concept of sort of unit of consciousness, which you'll run into in a lot of forms of Buddhism, if not all, a sort of a way of deconstructing the identity or understanding that you might not be anything at all. That in fact, you're part of everything. And in that, there's a potential relief from suffering in that, not just like intellectually knowing it, but becoming it. Now, whereas in Bhakti Yoga, there's this idea of like, the best thing is to be the individual because individuals are required for love, this for love to work, embodied love. And so the quality, the thing we call the experience of love is something that can be cultivated. It doesn't just have to be for another person. It doesn't have to be for the stranger on the bus. It doesn't have to be for sweaty Bruce Springsteen's lover that you could actually, you can actually shift that love to the divine, to God. Cause obviously it's the Hare Krishnas, it's a theistic religion. They believe in Krishna who is the, from the POV of Vaisnava Bhakti Yoga, the Godhead, the source from which everything flows into time and space. So there are all these like fascinating stories of Krishna. It's not just, most people are familiar with Krishna from the Bhagavad Gita. They're about to be more, what's cool about it is cause it's like they're making the Oppenheimer movie and he famously quoted the Bhagavad Gita when they split the atom. But there's all these stories of Krishna that are not just in the Bhagavad Gita. And these stories, they could seem very simple when taken literally, but in Vaisnava Bhakti Yoga, it's this very advanced theistic yogic system. So they take these stories and from these stories, they extrapolate this incredible analysis of what love is and how to connect with the universe. So like Krishna has a lover, Radharani. And so sometimes they're getting along. Sometimes they're fighting. Sometimes they're separated. And so each of these ways of feeling about Krishna are modes of love. So longing actually is considered one of the highest forms of love. The idea is the longing is the grace. The longing is the love. So when you find yourself in a situation of longing and heartbreak, it is identical to union. And perhaps more intensely representative of the essence of what is love. Yes, and they call it pining. So there's the, and it's pining for Krishna. And there's also, there's other ways you could be with Krishna is as a friend. So this is another form of love or as a mother, because Krishna has a mother. So there's like all these ways of like looking at the various forms of love. And it's a really beautiful form of yoga. That's emphasizing the individual and the individual as a kind of channel to this universal love. Yeah, there's a lot of different like their answer to the question of what shows up in Buddhism as absolute and relative reality. Like that obviously there's relative reality. We're not right now, you and me are not unit of consciousness. Like you zoom back far enough and we're gonna seem like an atom or whatever. The thing is, the trope is you can zoom back far enough and we're in a whatever, we're in a piece of cheese or something, who knows. But in that way we're like completely unified. But simultaneously we're individuals, like for sure we're individuals. Like you still gotta pay your taxes. You gotta know your social security number. That's relative reality. So, you know, Buddhism is like kind of the balance. Again, when I say Buddhism is I'm a comedian podcast or I'm not some Buddhist expert. This is just probably my confused idea of what it is. But anyway, in bhakti yoga, there's the concept, it's called, I'm gonna mispronounce it, asinka, sinka, beta, tatva. I'm sorry, I'm mispronouncing it. Which means simultaneous oneness and difference. So. Oneness and difference. Yes, simultaneous oneness and difference. So that's why the oneness is the more part of the same piece of cheese and the difference is we are still each paying taxes. Yes, and in this case, the cheese is Krishna. So, you know, or other ways it gets described is like, you know, a photon blasting off the sun has sunlight qualities, but it's not the sun. Humans being one of the many things, you know, flowing out of the creative consciousness of the divine have qualities that are weirdly like the godlike. You know, like we, in fact, we wanna control primarily. That's one of the problems, like humans wanna be in control, wherein from their, the bhakti yoga perspective, Krishna is effortlessly controlling everything. And so within the system, the individual parts of the system have that same quality, but you can't, you're probably not God. You might be, I'm not. I'm not. What do you think happens after we die? Having come close to that, that, that cliff and almost got pushed over once. What do you think happens when you do get pushed off the cliff? Okay. I feel dumb that I'm even gonna like preface this by saying, obviously I have no fucking idea. And I think that's one of the cool things about death. No idea. The CIA probably does. You think the CIA, I love like, we've decided your audience is the CIA. Yeah, yeah. How would you, oh, wait. I need to, cause there's a lot of suspicion that I might be FSB and Marsad. So I'm trying to rebrand. I'm trying to steer them into the CIA direction. As far as what happens when you, when you die, one thing I returned to when I'm getting overly complex is the idea of as above, so below. So that you can, a lot of the big questions can be answered by your own experience now. So in other words, like in terms of thinking about like death, if you look back to baby Lex versus adult Lex, where's the baby? Like baby's gone. They, you've regenerated all your cells many times by then. So in a way you could say Lex baby died. The death didn't look like a typical, and I'm not trying to dodge it, but I'm just saying it was very natural that the death of that baby. It just, it just. In many ways that baby died, but I am, at least personally I'm surprised how much the person is exactly the same. So there's many ways in which you're very different, but there's a lot of ways in which you're very much the same. And I wonder if that, if there's, if life is defined by many deaths that continue on, and then I wonder if there's something persists beyond in this, that, yeah, there is something that still persists, I wonder. Okay, so that. Now, you know, obviously there's so many different answers to this question that are religious, and ranging from like the most absurd shit you ever heard in your life, like the gold. You're gonna get a mansion. There's gold streets. Like, I don't, do you want like gold streets? Who offers gold streets? I know about the virgins, but there's a bunch of virgins. The Christians give you the gold streets in the mansion. Like depending on the, whatever the particular sect of Christianity is, you know, it's like some kind of city. There's, it's like paved with gold. No one's addressing the fact that at the moment the streets are made of gold. Gold is a valueless substance. I mean, it's sort of pretty in a cheesy kind of way, but no one's gonna give a shit about it. It's like, if there was not a lot of asphalt in the world, then, you know, we'd be in heaven from that same, that way of thinking. But the, or honestly, when going back, this is starting to get a theme with Gulag Archipelago. I'm sorry, I'm reading it currently. That's a sticky book. Yeah, it's very sticky in your mind. Very, very tough. As I'm running through very hot heat, I'm listening to Gulag Archipelago. Oh my God. And you know, one of the things they said, they would feed prisoners salt, and then they would exchange, the prisoners would be able to give up anything, everything, their gold, their possessions, everything for just one drink of water. So that little context of dehydrating them and feeding them salt changes your value system completely. So maybe the gold is supposed to be a metaphor for something that you still value deeply. Yes, it's, yeah, again, any of these things, when you like take them literally, they seem absurd. But if you look deeper into it, it's like quite beautiful. But the Buddhist version of it is that there's a momentum. The best way to put it is it's the kind of momentum. So the thing you're talking about, which is the personality of the baby that is still in the adult, which is still in the old person, you're looking at a kind of momentum that does not stop upon the extinction of the body. Now, I think there's a lot of, I don't want to say harm, because they didn't mean to hurt, but I think there's some harm that maybe has happened from the way death is represented in movies. Like when people die in movies, it's like there's this, usually it's pretty fast, even if it is what they're dying from is a longterm disease, it like wraps up pretty quickly, starts with a cough, the person's in bed, but there's this weird kind of lucidity to the person up until the point of death. And also they generally, in movies, they have makeup on, which is always funny to me when the person dying looks great. If you've ever been around a dying person, they're dying. They look like shit. You're dying. They're all gray and like confused. They're, you know, when you're around dying people, they will spin through time. Your parents won't recognize you for a second. They'll think you're somebody else. They won't, they're like everything's like the process is happening. So you're very confused when you die. So in general, not all the time, some people die with a clear mind. It just depends on the type of death, but think in terms of getting hit by a car. So you went across the street, you get hit by a car. Now, if we're talking about this momentum continuing, the confusion, assuming you didn't hit your head and you're unconscious, like somehow you just got smashed and you're like bleeding out, even then you're gonna be confused because you're getting dizzy, like blood's leaving your body. You're like, things are fading out. Your vision's going. So it's a very confusing experience initially when the body dies. If you are a materialist who has been, who has convinced themselves that it's a permanent thing, the next bit of confusion is going to be when you realize something is persisting here, like I'm still here. And this is where you run into the near death experiences, which are a global phenomena that don't seem to be completely shaped by culture. Like regardless of what part of the world people are having these experiences in, the reports tend to be similar and everyone's heard it, the light, the life review, seeing ancestors and stuff like that. Now, I don't know what that is. I don't know. Sometimes I think that's probably just like a built in way the computer shuts down. This is something it does, who knows? But in Buddhism, the concept is this momentum persists into something called the bardo. The bardo means in between. And there's an actual number of days they say that you get to hang out there. And I can't remember, it's like 37 days or 29 days or something, I'm not sure. But at least from the time space perspective, that's how long they're there. Within this place, there are a lot of technological parallels, man. It's like in the way the algorithm is reflective, it assesses your desires or whatever and then produces something that has within it a component of attraction to you. Apparently this happens in the bardo. Or the way you wake up in the morning and you're in a shitty mood. And then coincidentally, everyone that day is an asshole. If you don't catch it, you could just be like, wow, I guess it's act like an asshole day. You don't realize you're seeing your asshole projection being reflected off the screen of another person. So in the bardo apparently, you don't need people for the reflective quality. These projections happen and they appear as either Nietzsche's demon or Nietzsche's angel. It just depends on where you're at and how you died. And if you died scared, then at least initially that's gonna be some scary shit you see around you. If you died in a peaceful way, well then there's gonna be more of a possibility of navigation through this liminal intermediary place. And so thus the emphasis on meditation in Buddhism, a way to calm one's self, to not be distracted by thoughts, which are their own like apparitions. And then theoretically, if you wanted to, instead of spinning the wheel again and jumping back into a body, you could choose not to do that. And then transcend the wheel of birth and death. But if you still wanted to go back, if you still wanted to go back or return or whatever, however you wanna put it, then you could have more control over what your next birth might be versus in this depiction of things, people running from demons that they don't recognize as their own projection into any fucking body that they can find. Because if you've had a body, you want a body. And so this is how you can incarnate as an animal. This is how you can incarnate in the hell realms. This is how you can incarnate in any variety of things. But the idea is like maybe you could slow down a little bit and like choose a birth that is gonna be more conducive to you continuing to like spiritually evolve. I like that idea. Is it true or not? Who the fuck knows? Algorithmically speaking, it seems like a really fun role playing game where you basically keep improving the different parameters based on your ability and willingness to meditate and let go of the menial concerns of life on earth. Why do you think Buddhists see life as suffering? What's suffering? Okay, well, first of all, that gets mistranslated quite a bit. You're talking about the four noble truths. The first one is, often it's translated as life is suffering, which is not it, it's there is suffering. The whole life is suffering thing is just like a spiritual version of life's a bitch, then you die. And people hear that and they're like, yeah, life is fucking suffering, but it's there is suffering, there is suffering. So it's an affirmation. If you're like this thing that a lot of people feel that they associate with lots of, they have a lot of reasons they think they're feeling it is known as fundamental dissatisfaction. So another word for suffering, maybe it could be fundamental dissatisfaction. Also, the term itself, maybe a better translation is wobbly wheel. So like, imagine like when your bike doesn't have, or your car doesn't have enough air in the tires, your bike doesn't have enough air in the tires, it's kind of a shitty bike ride. Like no matter what, it's kind of like uncomfortable. It's like irritating. So this is what's being pointed to is that there's this quality within a human life that is unsatisfying. Like a wobbly wheel. Wobbly wheel. Why do you think, what is the core of that dissatisfaction? Because it could be as simple as kind of physical and mental discomfort and sadness and depression and all that kind of stuff. Or it could be more speaking to the sort of existentialist, the philosophical, the absurdity of it all. The fact that stuff happens, good stuff happens for no reason, bad stuff happens for no reason. Yeah, it's no matter how much you try, there's not a universal fairness to the whole thing. There's not even a universal meaning to the whole thing. So the existentialist perspective. What flavor of suffering do you prefer? If it was an ice cream shop. That's so funny. Well, I'm definitely picking desire over the, like if in the RGB that we're talking about here is desire, aversion and ignorance. So if you want to find like the three ingredients that are giving everyone their sophisticated bits of suffering, there you go. That's what it is. In which way does desire manifest itself in suffering? It hurts. To lose, to not have. Like, yeah, it hurts to not, like to eternally not have, but just like my friend pointed this out. He's like, you know, like you order something from Amazon. Like even in the smallest way, you're excited about whatever the thing is. You order this thing from Amazon, it's not coming for four days. So those four days are going to be somewhat marked by you being what people say, I'm excited about it. But really, if you look at that feeling, it's uncomfortable. Like the feeling of wanting the thing is uncomfortable. So that is a form of suffering. That's suffering. Interesting. I mean, I wonder, cause we naturally reframe that in our mind, wanting. We reframe that as a good thing. As a, and maybe suffering is fundamentally good in the way we think of what life is. So like, it's life affirming, but it's not usually how the word suffering is used. Well, it's true. It's true. Like the first noble truth of Buddhism is true. It's called the truth of suffering. There is suffering. I mean, this is like an, I don't know, an element that you can't break it down any further than that. Like there is suffering, this is truth. So if you think, you know, and again, assigning like good or bad to truth, I think maybe there's more of a sort of neutrality there. It's just what it is. It's truth. I mean, is it any, is it basically, is suffering any disturbance from stillness? Is suffering then? Like basically any, anything that happens in life that, that's like, that perturbs the system. Ripples in the empty. Ripples. Ripples, yeah. So a still lake is empty of suffering, but any kind of ripple is suffering in that sense. A still lake is empty of suffering. You sound like a Zen master. It seems like something a Zen master might say. If I can just grow a beard like yours. Ah, no, the beard doesn't help. We would, we would. If I had your chin, you think I'd have a fucking beard? I look like a stork. You should see me. If I had your chin, there'd be no beard here. You have a symmetrical, nice chin. This is the closest I can come to plastic surgery. Pubic plastic surgery, friend. That's how you know you're a professional comedian. Yeah, so suffering. There is suffering. And the lake analogy is pretty good because the, um, what's happening here is that, that we have become identified with something that we call a self. So this, the self is just accepted. I have a self, I have an identity, I'm a person, I have a self. But when you start doing scans to try to find yourself, which is the entire thing. I'm going to find myself. You get in a van, go to California, take some acid, fuck a prostitute on the bus or whatever Kerouac did. Too far? I'm going to find myself. Oh, he didn't, she wasn't a prostitute, just to correct the record. Oh, previously a prostitute. I guess once a prostitute, always a prostitute. You know what? She's a former prostitute. I don't think that. No, and look, I'm not, I'm not a sign, look, all I'm saying is, uh, I don't care. Who cares? Who has a bit of prostitute? God, I used to be one of them. We're all kind of a kind of prostitute. Yeah, yes, yes. But the. We make love and we make money. Therefore, we're all a kind of prostitute. We make, God, how great. I would really love to be able to make money by fucking. I mean, it's maybe not directly, but in some sense. Directly. Oh. Yeah. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. Do you accept Venmo or? Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. It's never too late to start. That's so, sort of one of the ways in is this sort of contemplation of the identity, because it's like, uh, you know, what is, it's not just the desire, it's what is having the desire? Where, where does the desire live in? Like, what doesn't want to be where it's at? What is the thing that is like desperately wanting to get out of the situation it's in? And then, um, as far as ignorance, uh, it's still something that's theoretically happening to an identity. So, so wrapped up in it is really just this sort of like, and that's where we run into what, uh, into attachment. So if, if the first noble truth of Buddhism is there is suffering, the second noble truth of Buddhism is, um, the cause of this suffering is attachment. And so people hear that and they take it, that's a, there's a lot of levels to that concept. Definitely the cause of suffering is attachment. Like, God, I just got addicted to vapes. Is there a more embarrassing addiction than vapes? I'm smoking like a little purple thing. It tastes like sugar. It's attachment. It is, there is suffering. I want it. I have to charge it now. I'm embarrassed by it. It makes me feel out of control. There's a lot of suffering, but also there's deeper levels of attachment that go all the way to this attachment to the sense of one's self. And I think the existentialists do get into this idea in a different way, which is like, because I think I'm a me, now I have to push what that thing is out into the world through my actions. And that's a kind of attachment too. Exactly. There you go. Right. And that leads to the third noble truth, which is get rid of attachment and you won't suffer anymore. Uh, that's, it seems logical, but you know, it is a very, it is a mathematical analysis of this particular problem of suffering it's addressing. And then the fourth noble truth is the eightfold path of Buddhism, which is like a process by which one could unencumber oneself from this identification with something that isn't real. Do you need a bathroom break? Yeah. Thank you. I do. I appreciate that. There's a funny moment, I was running in the heat yesterday listening to Gulag Archipelago. And there's a, which was a very welcome break because I'm looking for any excuse to stop whatsoever. The gentleman, very nice gentleman stopped me saying, recognized me and just said a bunch of friendly things. And then he mentioned as one of the people who really inspires him is Duncan Trussell. And I was, I mean, I'm the same way and I told him, you know, tomorrow, it felt like a name drop. I name dropped you this morning. I was like, tomorrow I'm going to get to meet him. So he says, he says, hi. And there's, oh, and he said that he watched Midnight Gospel on mushrooms. And it was like the greatest mushroom experience of his life. I don't know. Yeah, man. Yeah, I was nervous about meeting you, man. Like I have so much respect for you. And like, oh yeah, I name dropped. I was saying I'm going on Lex's podcast today. It's, you look, we're so lucky we all live here. What the fuck? We're all living in Austin together. Like I, I somehow like missed that, but that's, we all got to hang out. We all have to like start doing stuff. Well, you have to really, also you have to appreciate this moment. I remember, I know some people are less sentimental than others, but I remember sitting with Joe Rogan and with Eric Weinstein, I believe it was. Yeah. And at the back of the comedy store shortly before COVID, I think. And just thinking like, there's no way these things will last. And these things meaning the comedy store, Joe Rogan, Joe Rogan, the Joe Rogan, like a, like a pocket influential podcasting person. Also a person like in this room, in this space, the ability to just talk for hours and lose ourselves in this moment. It just felt ephemeral, somehow temporary. And I just wanted to capture that moment somehow. Like, I don't know. Sometimes that's where the temptation to take a picture and you're that kind of stuff or record a podcast comes from. But it just felt like it would be, it'd be gone forever. Of course, Joe doesn't seem to have that kind of sentimental. No, sure, no, no. Just wherever you end up, you just enjoy the shit out of it. Right. That's it. Well, and that's something you have to cultivate. You don't, that's not an easy, the thing you're talking about, you know, God, have you seen these? I think the best analogy for what you're talking about, there's these videos where people give like a sugar cube to a raccoon, but the raccoons, they wash their food. So raccoon, or I think it's cotton candy. They give the raccoon cotton candy, immediately it washes the cotton candy. And of course the cotton candy dissolves in the water. And the raccoon is like, what the fuck? Like, you know, and the thing you're, that grasping you're talking about, it's like the raccoon washing the cotton candy. Like the moment you get into the grasping part, you paradoxically have pulled yourself out of the moment that inspired the grasping part. And that's, you know, that's some people, that's the entirety of their lives trying to record. I mean, Jesus, man, you ever see people film fireworks on the 4th of July with their phone? It's one of the most remarkable aspects of human behavior, which is like, you know they're not gonna watch the fireworks on their phone. Only a lunatic would do that. Like who's gonna go back and look at fireworks, but. So, but we're also in this position where, because of podcasting, there is some aspect where you can record a magical moment in time together between two people, or even just with a camera. So to get back to the lake that you were talking about, this is emptiness. So that's emptiness. That's what's known as emptiness. The lake is emptiness. And that's what we are, emptiness, emptiness. And that's another thing that gets very confused in Buddhism is that emptiness. And that emptiness is, that's to me, like when I'm going to do a podcast, that's where I try to go. I try to go just in the moment, no agenda. You know, if I am nervous or whatever, okay, I'll feel the nervousness, but just in the, just drop into the moment. That's when time changes. And then you look up, hours have passed. It feels like a second. And the reason it feels like that is because if you successfully dropped into the moment, it's the lake now, it's emptiness. It's forever for a second. You're like, you're dipping into eternity. And yeah, it's a very strange thing to, as part of that, record it, you know, as part of that, try to like grab it and put it out there, but it works. Can you speak to that, to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour? Can you speak about that purple lavender world you go to when it's most intense and successful for you, when you feel a sense of lightness and happiness when it works, whether it's your own or a conversation with Joe in general, or is, well, yours is very specific because it's audio only. Maybe you can also speak to that. Because you might as well be naked or you don't have to, you have to, you're free of the conventions of the real world. I will never stop thinking it's remarkable. Like the fact that I'm talking to you, to me, seems remarkable, not just technologically, but I'm talking to someone, I'm assuming I'm allowed to say this, who has robot dogs that I've been watching for years evolve on YouTube. Arms reach away from one of these things, you know? And I'm with somebody who is like an acclaimed genius. So for me, it's like, oh my God, how's, what, why do I get to have this conversation? Why do I get to be here? When there'd be like a line, there'd be a line that would just wrapped and wrapped and wrapped around this building of people who'd love a chance to just chat with you. And so when I, with my podcast, that's how I feel like when I'm talking to these guests, you know, who have spent, you know, some of them have like spent their entire lifetime meditating, you know, studying specific aspects of Buddhism or even when I'm with, you know, when I'm with comedians who I like consider to be brilliantly funny. So for me, it's just like, God, I almost feel like I've just created some sophisticated trap for cool people where like I get to like hang out with them. So you're like sitting in the gratitude of it, just feeling lucky. Yeah, yeah, feeling lucky and wrestling with imposter syndrome, you know, trying to like get that part of myself to shut up long enough so I could be in that moment that we're talking about, you know? And then I carry that with me. It's not just like you stop the podcast. It's like some of the things these people tell me or some of the ways they are, like it becomes part of me. And then I get to have a life or this thing that they gave me is in me forever. And so, yeah, it's, there's... Yeah, it's cool how conversation can just, a few sentences can change the direction of your life. If you're listening, if you're there to be transformed by the words, they will do the work. It's, and it's the full mix of it. It's usually when, if you look up to somebody, and it's true for me at least, I think it is for you that you start to look up to basically everybody you talk to. Yes, yes, good sign. That's a good sign. God forbid it goes the other way. You're in trouble. If all of a sudden you start looking down on people, because whatever crazy metric you're using, ooh, that would freak me out. I do feel like that's a quality of getting older. When I was younger, I really, like, I thought I was so smart. Like I thought I had it all figured out. Oh, really? So you're going, your ego is just going, taking a nose dive. I would like to say it's my ego taking a nose dive. Me and my friend talk about it a bunch. We've just always associated it with like doing acid for two decades straight. Like, I'm gonna just assume I'm just like slowly like spiraling into senility, you know? Like, I'm just like, all the confidence, all the like, oh, the certainty when you're having, like in college, having the great, oh, like, you know, you feel like you're a representative of Camus or some shit. You know what I mean? You read the myth of Sisyphus, and now you like it, know all existentialism and your certainty in regards to it is embarrassing, but you don't see it in that way. You just feel certain. And then that certainty, it just starts like, it starts crumbling a little bit. And then, yeah. You know, I get to actually intensely experience that certainty in many communities, but one in cryptocurrency. Young folks with the certainty that this technology will transform the world. And I mean, this is almost one of the big communities of the modern era where they believe that this will really solve so many of the problems of the world, and they believe in it very intensely. And aside from the technology and the details of the thing, all I see is the certainty and the passion in their eyes. They'll stop me. Let me explain you, let me just give me a chance to tell you why this thing is extremely powerful. And I just get to enjoy the glow of that, because it's like, wow, I miss having that certainty about anything. It's probably come over for me too. But when I was younger, it's like, only I deeply understand the relationship of man to his mortality. And I understood that most deeply, I think, when I was like 16 or 17. And I am the representative of the human condition. And all these adults with their busyness of day to day life and their concerns, they don't deeply understand what I understand, which is the only thing that matters is the absurdity of the human condition. Yeah, yeah. And let me quote you some Dostoevsky. Oh boy, and you speak Russian. Yes, I speak Russian. So you've read the Brothers Karamazov in Russian. Unfortunately, I have to admit that I read all of the Dostoevsky in English. I came to this country when I was 13. And at least don't remember, we read a lot, but we read Tolstoy, Pushkin, a lot of the Russian literature but it was in Russian. But I don't remember reading Dostoevsky. I wonder at which point does the Russian education system give you Dostoevsky? Because it's pretty heavy stuff. Second grade, it's probably the second grade. Russians are intense. Yes, they are, they very much are. I don't remember reading Dostoevsky, but I did tangent upon a tangent upon a tangent. I traveled to Paris recently on the way to Ukraine and was scheduled to talk to Richard Pevere and this pair that translate Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, just this famous pair that translate most of Russian literature to English. And I was planning to have a sequence of five, 10, 15 hour conversation with them about the different details of all the translations and so on. I just found myself in a very dark place mentally where I couldn't think about podcasts or anything like that. It caught me off guard. So I went to Paris and just laid there for a day. Not just being stressed about Ukraine and all those kinds of things, but I'm still, the act of translation is such a fascinating way to approach some of the deepest questions that this literature raises, which is like, how do I capture the essence of a sentence that has so much power and translate it into another language? That act is actually really, really interesting. And I found with my conversations with them, they've really thought through this stuff. It's not just about language, it's about the ideas in those books. And that also really makes me sad because I wonder how much is lost in translation. I'm currently, so when I was in Ukraine, I talked to a lot of, like half the conversations I had on the record were in Russian, and basically 100% of the record were in Russian in Russian versus in English. And just so much is lost in those languages. And I'm now struggling because I'm launching a Russian channel where there'll be a Russian overdub of Duncan. Wow. Your wow will now be translated into Russian. What's Russian wow? I don't, it'll just be wow probably. I'm so sorry for the difficulties of having to translate wow. Usually probably with wow they'll leave it unoverdubbed because people understand exactly what you mean. But that's an art form, and it's a weird art form. It's like how do you capture the chemistry, the excitement, the, I don't know, maybe the humor, the implied kind of wit. I don't know, there's just layers of complexity in language that it's very difficult to capture. And I wonder how, it is sad for me because I know Russian, how much is lost in translation. And the same, there's a brewing conflict and tension with China now, and so much is lost in the translation between those languages. Oh my God, yeah. And cultures, the entire, the music of the people is completely lost because we don't know the language, or most of us don't know the language. Yeah, how much of the conflict is just problems in translation? How much of all these problems that we're having are just the alien sense of this or that? It's just as simple as that. Words are getting just a tiny warp away from the intent of if, when we both speak the same language, we can still say something that offends someone when you never intended that at all. How much more so when like it's, not only is it a completely different sound, but the script itself is different. Like what is, the Russian writing, is it called Cyrillic or what's the name? Yeah, Cyrillic. Cyrillic, and I don't know the name for Chinese writing, but it's like, it's a continuum that like gets weirder and weirder looking, you know? Like it's, so yeah. Or less weird depending on your perspective. Yeah, I'm sure depending on where you're at. You know, I'm definitely, I'm about the farthest thing from a polyglot as there could be, man. Like, but I'll tell you, at one point when I was getting fascinated by Dostoevsky, I did have this very transient fantasy about learning Russian so that I could like understand the difference and it's. You were 17, 18 at the time. College. Yeah, college. Yeah, Brothers Karamazov lost in that book. Just like, oh God. So in love with it is. But there's definitely like, you know, Ukraine, and this is what a lot of the war is about is saying, you know, Ukraine and Russia are not the same people. There's a strong culture in Ukraine, there's a strong culture in Russia. But you know, I know because that's where my family's from, there is a fascinating, strong culture. But there's such strong cultures everywhere else too. Ireland has a culture, Scotland has a culture. Even like on a tiny island, you just have these like, subcultures that are more powerful than anything existing in human history. Like the Bronx, I don't know, like Brooklyn. Like different parts of New York have a certain culture. And then New York versus LA versus, well. And then certain places are looking for their culture. Like I don't, I think Austin, I don't know what Austin is. And I don't think anyone knows. There's a traditional Austin, and then it's evolving constantly. Same with Boston, a place I spent a lot of time. There's a traditional Boston and now it's evolving with the different younger people coming from university and staying and all of that is evolving. But underneath it, there's a core, like the American ideal of the value of the individual, the value of freedom, of freedom of speech, all those kinds of things that permeates all of that. And the same thing in the history of World War II permeates Ukraine and Russia, a lot of parts of Europe, the memories of all that suffering and destruction, the broken promises of governments and the occupier versus the liberator, all that kind of stuff. All that permeates the culture. That affects how cynical or optimistic you are, or how much you appreciate material possessions versus human connection, all that kind of stuff. Yeah, it's, I mean, this is like, talk about absurdity. I mean, this is, war is like, it's what absurdity looks like. It's some kind of organized madness. None of it makes sense, like all of it, like it's just, none of it makes sense, but it does, but it doesn't. I mean, obviously you're defending yourself or you're taking orders that if you don't take, you're going to jail. And so, or somewhere in between, there's a classic story about this. Maybe it's a bullshit myth about World War II. I'm sure everyone's heard it because it comes up, you know, it's Christmas Eve and they have a ceasefire. kind of like, whoa, wow, what do you know? Books are really good. But still, if you've been away from it for a while and you revisit it, I know what you're saying. I just think probably it's not gonna go in that direction, even though you are right. Ultimately, I think you're right. Yeah, because our brain is the imagination engine we have is able to fill in the gaps better than a lot of graphics engines could. And so if there's a way to incentivize humans to become addicted to the use of imagination, it's like, you know, that's the downside of things like porn that remove the need for imagination for people. And in that same way, video games that are becoming ultra realistic, you don't have to imagine anything. And I feel like the imagination is a really powerful tool that needs to be leveraged. Because to simulate reality sufficiently realistically that we would be perfectly fooled, technically it's very hard. And so I think we need to somehow leverage imagination. Sure, I mean, yeah, I mean, this is like, this is what I love and is so creepy about like the current AI chatbots, you know, is that it's like, it's the relationship between you and the thing and the way that it can via whatever the algorithms are. And by the way, I have no idea how these things work, you do. I just, you know, speculate about what they mean or where it's going. But there's something about the relation between the consumer and the technology. And when that technology starts shifting according to what it perceives that the consumer is looking for or isn't looking for, then at that point, I think that's where you run into the, you know, yeah, it doesn't matter if the reality that you're in is like photo realism for it to be sticky and immersive. It's when the reality that you're in is via cues you might not even be aware of, or via your digital imprint on Facebook or wherever, when it's warping itself to that to seduce you, holy shit, man, that's where it becomes something alien, something, you know, when you're reading a book, obviously the book is not shifting according to its perception of what parts of the book you like. But when you imagine that, imagine a book that could do that, a book that could sense somehow that you're really enjoying this character more than another, you know? And depending on the style of book, kills that fucking character off or lets that character continue. I mean, that to me is sort of the where AI and VR, when those two things come together, whoa, man, that's where you're in, that's where you really are gonna find yourself in a Skinner box, you know? So the dynamic storytelling that senses your anxiety and tries to, there's a kind of this, in psychology, this arousal curve. So there's a dynamic storytelling that keeps you sufficiently aroused in terms of, not sexually aroused, like in terms of anxiety, but not too much where you freak out. It's this perfect balance where you're always on edge, excited, scared, that kind of stuff, and the story unrolls. It breaks your heart to where you're pissed, but then it makes you feel good again, and finds that balance. Yeah. The chatbots scare you, though? I'd love to sort of hear your thoughts about where they are today, because there is a different perspective we have on this thing, because I do know, and I'm excited about a lot of the different technologies that feed AI systems, that feed these kind of chatbots. And you're more a little bit, on the consumer side, you're a philosopher of sorts. They're able to interact with AI systems, but also able to introspect about the negative and the positive things about those AI systems. There's that story with a Google engineer saying that. I had him on my podcast, Blake Lemoine. You did. What was that like? What was your perspective of that, looking at that as a particular example of a human being being captivated by the interactions with an AI system? Well, number one, when you hear that anyone is claiming that an AI has become sentient, you should be skeptical about that. I mean, this is a good thing to be skeptical about, and so initially when I heard that, I was like, ah, it's probably just, who knows? Somebody who's a little confused or something. So when you're talking to them and you realize, oh, not only is he not confused, he's also open to all possibilities. He doesn't seem like he's super committed other than the fact that he's like, this is my experience. This is what's happening. This is what it is. So to me, there's something really cool about that, which is like, oh shit, I don't get to lean into like, I'm not quite sure your perceptual apparatus is necessarily like, I don't, you know, in the UFO community, I think I've just learned this term. It's called, instead of gaslighting, swamp gassing, which is, you know what I mean? People have this experience, you're like, it was swamp gas. You didn't see the thing. And you know, skeptical people, we have that tendency. If you hear an anomalous experience, your first thought more than likely is gonna be really, it could have been this or that or whatever. So to me, he seems really reliable, friendly, cool, and like, it doesn't really seem like he has much of an agenda. Like, you know, going public about some thing happening at Google is not a great thing if you wanna keep working at Google. You know, it's, I don't know what benefit he's getting from it necessarily. But all that being said, the other thing that's culturally was interesting and is interesting about it is the blowback he got, the passionate blowback from people who hadn't even looked into what Lambda is or what he was saying Lambda is, which they were like saying, you're talking about, and you should have your show actually, but. There's complexity on top of complexities. For me personally, from different perspectives, I also, and sorry if I'm interrupting your flow. Please interrupt, it's a podcast. Yeah, well, we're having multiple podcasts in multiple dimensions and I'm just trying to figure out which one we wanna plug into. I, because I know how a lot of the language models work and I work closely with people that really make it their life journey to create these NLP systems, they're focused on the technical details. Like a carpenter's working on Pinocchio is crafting the different parts of the wood. They don't understand when the whole thing comes together, there's a magic that can fill the thing. Yeah, I definitely know the tension between the engineers that create these systems and the actual magic that they can create, even when they're dumb. I guess that's what I'm trying to say. What the engineers often say is like, well, these systems are not smart enough to have sentience or to have the kind of intelligence that you're projecting onto it. It's pretty dumb, it's just repeating a bunch of things that other humans have said and stitching them together in interesting ways that are relevant to the context of the conversation, it's not smart. It doesn't know how to do math. To address that specific critique from a non programming person's perspective, he addressed this on my podcast, which is, okay, what you're talking about there, the server that's filled with all the, whatever it is, what people have said, the repository of questions and responses and the algorithm that weaves those things together to produce it using some crazy statistical engine, which is a miracle in its own right. They can like imitate human speech with no sentience. I mean, I'm honestly not sure what's more spectacular, really the fact that they figured out how to do that minus sentience or the thing suddenly like having, what is more spectacular here? Both occurrences are insane, which by the way, when you hear people being like, it's not sentient, it's like, okay, so it's not sentient. So now we have this hyper manipulative algorithm that can imitate humans, but it's just code and it's like hacking humans via their compassion. Holy shit, that's crazy too. Both versions of it are nuts, but to address what you just said, he said that's the common critique is people are like, no, you don't understand. He's just gotten really good at grabbing shit from the database that fits with certain cues and then stringing them together in a way that makes it seem human. He said, that's not when it became awake. It became awake when a bunch of those repositories, a bunch of the chatbots were connected together. That Lambda is sort of an amalgam of all the Google chatbots and that's when the ghost appeared in the machine via the complexity of all the systems being linked up. Now, I don't know if that's just like turtles all the way down or something, I don't know. But I liked what he said, because I like the idea of thinking, man, if you get enough complexity in a system, does it become like the way a sail catches wind, except the wind that it's catching is sentience. And if sentience is truly embodied, it's a neurological byproduct or something, And then I think they played soccer, they sing Christmas songs, and then they had to force them into fighting again. And so when those moments happen, the, are you familiar with Hakeem Bey? He's a controversial figure. Sadly, like he, like, I think he was like, I'm not going to defame him because I haven't like researched it correctly, but some people have said shit, but since I don't know the reference, I'm not going to. But regardless, I mean, you know, look, I'm sorry, but Bill Cosby was funny. You know, like that's a funny comedian, but you know the other stuff. Michael Jackson, he could fucking dance. And sing. And sing, but there's some other stuff. But regardless, Hakeem Bey came up with the idea of something called a temporary autonomous zone, which is that within a structure, a cultural structure, a temporary bubble of freedom will appear that by its nature gets sort of popped by the bigger bubble, or it runs out of resources generally is what happens. So these things will appear just out of the blue that it's almost like, imagine if like on earth in some tiny little bit of earth, the gravitational field was reduced by some percentage. And all of a sudden you could jump really high or whatever, but it wouldn't last. It's like that culturally, all the restrictions and the darkness and the heaviness and all of it for a second, somehow this bubble appears where humans come together as the hippie ideal. Brothers, sisters, just humans, earthlings instead of American, Chinese, Russian, Ukrainian temporary autonomous zone, it gets crushed by the default reality that it was appearing in. But somehow within that space, you witness the possibility, the possibility, the frustrating possibility that anyone who's thought about humanity knows this possibility, which is like, it seems like we can just get along. Like it does seem like we're pretty much the same thing and that we can just get along. Those moments are really rare. It's sad. I talked to a lot of soldiers, a lot of people that suffered through the different aspects of that war. Or war, and there's an information war that convinces each side that the other is not just the enemy, but less than human. Right. So there's a real hatred towards the other side. Yeah. And those kind of little moments where you realize, oh, they're human like me. Yeah. And not just like human like me, but they have the same values as me. And this woman who was a really respected soldier, she specializes in anti tank missiles. And she's very kind of, very pragmatic, very the enemy is the enemy, you have to destroy the enemy and saying like, there's no compassion towards the enemy. They're not human. They're less than human. But she said there was a moment when she remembers an enemy soldier in a tank took a risk to save a fellow soldier. And that risk was really stupid because he was facing, he was going to get destroyed. And then she said that she tried to shoot a rocket at that tank and she missed. And then she later went home and she couldn't sleep that she missed. How could she screw that up? But then she realized that actually she missed, maybe she missed on purpose. Yeah. Because she realized that that man, just like she is, was a hero, just like she strives to be. They were both heroes defending their own. And in that way, he was just like her. She was like, that's the only time I remember during this war ever feeling like this is another human being. But that was a very brief moment for her. And I just hear that over and over and over again. These romantic notions we have of we're one, that we're all just human. Unfortunately during war, those notions are rare. And it's quite sad. And war in a certain way really destroys those notions. And one of the saddest things is it destroys it, at least from what I see, potentially for generations. Not just for those people for the rest of their life, but for their children, their children's children. The hatred. I mean, I ask that question of basically everyone, which is will you ever forgive, asking of Ukrainians, will you ever forgive the Russians? Will, do you have hate in your heart towards the Russians? Or do you have love for a fellow human being? And there's different ways that people struggle with that. Different people, they saw that, they saw the love, they saw the hate with their known heart. And they struggle with the hate they have. And they know they can overcome it in a period of weeks and months after the war is over. But some people said, no, this hate that was, that showed up in February when the war started will be with me forever. Well, yeah, their kids got killed. What the fuck are you gonna do about that? Like, I don't care. I've got aphorisms and cute little stories about, you're still in prison if you hate your former captors. But man, I gotta tell you, if somebody hurt my kids, I'm not coming back. I mean, there's no amount, at least right now in my approximation, of spiritual literature, meditation, or anything that I can really think of that is going to give me that kind of space. Like, I think I imagine in the same way like, I imagine I could probably run a marathon eventually, but do I think I'm ever gonna do that? That times a million. So man, all we can do is have compassion for their hate because it's like, what are you gonna say? What are you gonna say to someone like that? Oh, oh, you know, for the sake of humanity, let it go. It was just your kids. It was just something you loved more than anything in the world. You'll never be okay again. You're gonna have nightmares for the rest of your life. But you should forgive. No. Well, there is truth in the fact that forgiveness is the way to let go, right? But that truth is not, fuck you, right? Which is why it's not your job to say that. Not that you're doing that, I know you're not. But you know, the problem with people like me, early phase, you could get this stupid missionary thing going where you like, start trying to like, I don't know, like proselytize ideals that you might be incapable of, you know? And I just, hearing it, you know, that's the, man, I saw this, the thing that like, I mean, I've seen a lot, all of us by now, probably if we were online, I've seen, and you just saw it in person. Like we've seen things that are just horrific. But as a dad, man, I just saw this clip of this kid around the age of my kid, walking by himself, these refugees, just walking by himself, crying, the look on his face, I can't explain the look on his face. I don't know what happened to his parents. I don't know what happened. Like I, it was so upsetting. Like even thinking about it now, it's just like, fuck, that could have been my kid. That could have been my kid, you know? So knowing that kind of, that, that kid's gotta grow up now. And I don't know, is the kid's parents still there? And that's just one of countless orphans out there now. So what you have this hate, and the question is how to direct it. Because the choice is you can direct it towards the politicians that started the war. You can direct it towards the soldiers that are doing the killing, or you can direct it towards an entire group of people. And that's the struggle because hate slowly grows to where you don't just hate the soldiers. You don't just hate the leaders. You hate all Russians because they're all equally evil because the ones that aren't doing the fighting are staying quiet. And I'm sure the same kind of stories are happening on the other side. And so there is, that hate is one that is deeply human, but you wonder for your own future, for your own home, for building your own community, for building your own country, how does that hate morph over the weeks and months and years? Not into forgiveness, but into something that's productive that doesn't destroy you. Because hate does destroy. That's the dark aspect of a rocket that hits a building and kills hundreds of people. The worst effect of that rocket is the hate in the hearts of the loved ones to the people that were in that building. That hate is a torture over a period of years after. And that it doesn't just torture by having that psychological burden and trauma. It also tortures because it destroys your life. It prevents you from being able to enjoy your life to the fullest. It prevents you from being able to flourish as a human being, as a professional, in all those kinds of ways that humans can flourish. And I don't know. It's such a, there is an aspect where this naive notion is really powerful, that love and forgiveness is the thing that's needed in this time. And when I talk to soldiers, they don't, I remember bringing up to Jaco, is there a sense where the people you're fighting are just brothers in arms, bringing up the Dire Straits song, Brothers in Arms? And he was basically, without swearing, saying fuck that, that they're the enemy. Yeah, I mean, he's literally in survival mode. He can't think like that. It's gonna create latency in the system and that's gonna lower his survivability. You can't think that. I mean, we're talking about cognitively. You can't have latency. Like, if you're, that one moment of hesitation, you see it sometimes in these YouTube videos of like somebody, a new cop has been unfortunate enough to run into something that is a phenomenon, suicide by cop. Somebody has a knife and that person is running towards them with a knife and they're begging the person to stop, that you can hear it in their voice. They're begging, stop, stop, stop, stop. And the person is not gonna stop. So the critique of that is that that latency could potentially not just lead to the cop getting killed, but to that person with a knife killing other people. And so, you know, I get, if I were out there, I think that like, you probably just as a matter of like not getting shot and being fully in the moment, you have to be like that. I would guess, I don't know. I don't know, I'm the furthest thing from a soldier there could be, but there's something Jack Kornfield, this great Buddhist teacher says, which is tend to the part of the garden you can touch. Meaning this is where we're at right now. Thank God you and I, though we are experiencing some like ripples from what's going on over there, everyone is, we're not there. And thank God we don't have to come up with the psychological program for people going through that to no longer be encumbered by that hate. Thank God. And I don't know if that's just lazy or whatever, but it's like, you know, for me, I just, I have to bring it back to, all right, well, here's where I'm at now. And I don't want there to be war. I don't want to hurt people, but yeah, I love what you said. I think what you said is the, if anything, is the most intelligent way of looking at it. It's like, don't pretend that you're not gonna feel that hate, like you're gonna feel it. There's no way around it. Or like, cause that's even worse. Cause then you're almost saying like something's wrong with them for feeling the hate or, you know, whatever. But more along the lines, if you can avoid applying that hate to an entire country of people, then do that. Like, just understand, we're talking about like a, not everybody. I know it's not everybody. I know it's not everybody. It's just easier, isn't it? Cognitively, it's somehow easier to think all Russians, monsters, you know, all Russians, all whatever the particular like thing is that you're supposed to not like. It's easier somehow, weirdly. You'd think that'd be more difficult. Yeah, but I guess the lesson is if you give in to the easy solution, that's going to lead to detrimental longterm effects. So hate should be, it's such a powerful tool that you should try to control it for your own sake. Not because you owe anything to anybody, but for your own psychological development over time. Right, right, that's it, that's it, fuck. Yeah, yeah. In terms of dark places, you suffered from depression. Where has been some of the darker places you've gone in your mind? You know, I needed therapy, man. I needed therapy for the longest time, I just didn't get it. So because of that, I would go through like bouts of like paralytic depression, like suicidal depression, suicidal ideations that were more than just ideations. I mean, I think like people get afraid when the thought of suicide appears in their consciousness, they get really scared of themselves. So they think there's something like, fuck, what's going on with me? Why would I think that? But I think if we are suffering and, you know, as a natural part of not wanting to reduce suffering or not feel bad anymore, I mean, suicide is going to be an, like, if we're just, you know, you're just looking, what are all the options? Let's brainstorm here. You know what I mean? I could start drinking more water. You start jogging, get some therapy, call my friends, all the stuff we all hear. Or I could just, I think the height of my apartment building is probably the, definitely the right height to kill myself. And then, so where, for me, like the few times where the ideation has gone towards like, well, when would I do that? How do I, what, you know, what do I need to like accomplish that? When then like, that's where it gets really fucking scary. That's where it's like terrifying. And so you start the actual details of the planning of how to commit suicide. Yeah. What's going to be the least painful way to do it? What's going to be the most instantaneous way to do it? What's the, you know, and with, you know, with depression, because it can be progressive, you know, this is why you have to really just stay on top of it. Anyone who's gone through depression knows what I'm talking about. You gotta stay on top of it. Like you might need medication. You know, I know this is controversial now, but it's still better than dying if you ask me. But at some point with depression, it like becomes paralyzing. So you don't want to get out of bed anymore and you're not taking showers anymore. And you don't want to talk to anybody anymore. And you're not answering your phone anymore. And, you know. So like in a dark place that you might be in, it still might get worse. So you should really do everything you can to get under control. And that's the problem with that specific psychological disorder. That's the problem. Because the things it's like, if you start listening to what you want to, you think it's you, it's the depression. You start listening to it. It wants you to stay in bed. And then you're getting those fucking depression sleeps, you know, or you wake up and you're more tired. Like it's not working. You're trying to escape reality by sleeping. And so, yeah. Like you have to like, you're fighting for your, you're literally fighting for your life. It might not seem like that. Cause you can't, if you could see depression, if you could see it, if you knew you had some inky, vaporous octopus thing that was just wrapping around you more and more and more and more, you would probably do everything you could to rip that fucking thing off your body. And if you couldn't get it off your body, you would be calling people to get help. So it doesn't feel like a fight because you're exhausted. There's no reason to move. There's no, you don't see the meaning for any of it. So it doesn't feel like a battle, but it is a battle. You're not feeling. I mean, that's the other thing. You're just, you're basically not feeling. You're like, you start going numb. At least that was my experience with it. Numb and tired. And then increasingly numb and tired. And then increasingly sort of disconnecting from reality. And then somewhere in there, that's when you start playing around with the idea of like, oh, I don't know if it's worth it. I don't know. Now, you know, I think compared to some of my friends who haven't survived, obviously who haven't survived depression, like mine was definitely not whatever theirs was like. I've heard, I mean, to understand it for folks out there, maybe you haven't gone through it. Just imagine if like, how bad you have to feel if death is the solution, like violence against yourself so that you die is the solution. Like just, it flies in the face of everything. So yeah, that was definitely the darkest place that I've ever been. Just that death doesn't seem like, because you don't care about anything anymore, that death just doesn't seem like that bad. Yeah. Like you're not able to appropriately assign the negative costs to the solution. Right. It just seems like a reasonable solution. Yeah, but I think also what's going along with it is like, it's not like your brain isn't working. Like you're not thinking, obviously you're not thinking clearly. Like, at least again, this was my experience of it. It's a fog. You're in some kind of, like you're confused. There's confusion. There's shame. You feel embarrassed. You feel embarrassed. You wanna get out of bed. You wanna do stuff. You wanna be compelled to be social and do all this stuff, but you're not, you're not. Like you seem, if people don't know what's going on and you're not telling them because you're embarrassed, because you want to have some like, you know, uncorrupted, unworped psyche, you know, you're like, it invites you to be secret about it. That's one of its first tricks is it tells you not to tell anybody. And that's deadly in that case, it's deadly. What was the source of light? What was the, what were for you and in general the ways out? Yeah, so for me, the solutions, and again, man, for my depressed friends out there, please don't get mad at me. I'm not doing the thing of like, just put on a smile or any of that bullshit because it doesn't feel like that when you're like, and when you're fighting it, it's like you are, you're in a, I don't know why I keep using these stupid gravity analogies, but it's like the gravity's been turned up on your planet in every single way by, so getting out of bed. You know, like. By the way, gravity and quantum mechanics, one of the most beautiful things about our reality, what the hell is each of those things? So this isn't, you're not just talking about hippie language, it's still physicists pretend they understand something. We're still at the very beginning of understanding this mysterious world of ours that seems to be functioning according to these weirdly simple and yet universally powerful laws, which we don't fully yet understand. So please, the metaphor and the analogy of gravity. Okay, thank you. Fully, fully applicable. I don't know any other way to put it than it's like somebody turned the gravitational field of your mattress up by. So everything is heavy. Heavy, your body's heavy. You don't wanna get out of bed, you will consider shitting or pissing the bed because you're just like, who gives a fuck, I'll just lay in my shit and piss. You're dying, you're like, none of it makes sense. And I feel like in retrospect, I'm making what I've done a little, like I had more lucidity. It was more of like when you're wrestling with someone and you're just like, it's different for you. But for me, if I'm wrestling, I'm not thinking about jujitsu moves. I'm like. Survival. You're just. So it's like that. It is a struggle. Like it's like, you really have to deliberately fight. Everything. So you start, so you can almost have a conversation with the depression. And then what you do is you start doing the opposite of everything it's telling you to do. So it's telling you lay in bed. So you get out of bed. It's definitely telling you don't fucking exercise. You're gonna go fucking exercise. That's not gonna do anything. You can't. You probably have a heart attack. You really wanna go outside. Don't go fucking exercise. And it'll feel crazy. And you won't wanna do it. If you wanted to do it, you wouldn't be depressed. Like how often do you hear like one of the symptoms of depression? You wanna jog. You wanna get on a bike. You know, you don't hear that. That's not a symptom. So you start, at least one solution I just started doing the opposite of. Whatever the voice is telling you, do the opposite. That. And then suddenly the gravitational field diminishes a little bit. It doesn't go all the way away. And that's where you can fall right back into it cause you just feel even slightly better. You're like, oh, okay, I fixed it. You know, really, I think if you like and having been through therapy, the best solution would be go to a fucking therapist as quickly as you can. Just sit down with them and tell them what's going on. I know what you're thinking. How am I gonna find a therapist? Just do it. Google it, go on Yelp. All of this shit feels impossible. You're like, I don't wanna turn on the computer. I don't wanna do any of this. You just have to. I mean, you have to. You do it if you're on fire. You do it if you're on fire. And someone's like, you know, here's a way to not be on fire. Just this particular fire is, it doesn't make you wanna run around screaming. It just makes you wanna fall asleep forever. And that, but those little steps, I got lucky because it worked. It worked, I started exercising. I'd been on antidepressants before when I was originally diagnosed with it. Did those help? You know, I, even with all the current research coming out about, that maybe we were all wrong about our understanding of depression, I do feel like it helped in a certain way. Like it definitely, it definitely like made me stop thinking about, it stopped the intrusive thoughts. And, but I don't know how much of that was placebo or how much of that, I don't know. But then also like I couldn't cum anymore. That was the other fucked up thing. Like you're, you can't have orgasms. And which might not sound like a big deal, but you know, when I told my therapist that they actually took me off them, cause I think she was realizing that it started diminishing a little bit. But the one I'm talking about now, that whatever episode or whatever you wanna call it, I just got lucky cause it worked. It worked and I started feeling better, thank God. Now, if you suffer from depression out there and you've had a remission of the depression, you know, it's really like, it's scary to have mental illness because everyone gets bummed out. I mean, that's just normal. Like you're gonna get bummed out and I don't wanna do anything sometimes. It doesn't mean you have a clinical depression. You might just be bummed out or grieving. You might be any number of things. But when I get really nervous, if some of those symptoms start showing up. And at one point I felt like that was happening again. And I did intramuscular ketamine therapy, which now that was the damnedest thing I've ever experienced. Aside from the fact that ketamine is immensely psychedelic. I just remember going back to the hotel after the experience with the clinician. And like, you know, it's like with depression, it's like a headache that starts coming on. But you're like, this headache might last for years. It might last for six months. It might get worse and worse and worse. And so I went back to the hotel room and it was just gone. Like I just felt normal. It felt great. It was like the most remarkable thing ever. So, you know, look at the research on ketamine right now. It's like, it's not like bullshit. It's not like woo science. There's really, really good data out there showing that something like, I think it's 60%. I don't know what the percentage is, but 60% of people with an endogenous depression when they get ketamine therapy will experience remission, regardless of whether you trip out or not. It just does something that I don't know if they know what it is yet. I don't care if they do. But that one thing worked. And basically you keep fighting until something works. Exactly. It's a survival issue. And it's a survival issue. But it's just, I think because it's kind of so slow moving, you might even forget it's progressive. Or, you know, you could easily just think that you're just a kind of bummed out person. Or you start thinking that these aspects of your psychology are permanent when they don't have to be. What about other people in your life? What advice would you give to people that have loved ones who suffer from depression? What are they to do? Okay, now this is really like, man, it's really dark. Here's number one. This is what somebody told me when I lost a friend to suicide, you know? Because when you lose a friend to suicide, when you lose a loved one to suicide, you're gonna blame yourself. It's like in the periphery of suicide, there is a circumference of guilty people who all feel like, oh, if only I'd said this at the right time, if only I'd listened more, if only I'd seen that warning sign, if only this or that. It's interesting in that with other forms of like disease, you know, if your loved one dies from cancer, say, more than likely, you're not gonna be thinking like, oh, I should have cured their cancer. You know, like it's a tragedy, but at least you're not like, oh, if only I had. You still might think that's part of grief, but. It's not as sticky in many of the other situations. Here, the guilt couldn't really stay for a long time. Yep, so you, number one, we're talking about a progressive disease that can lead to death. And if somebody commits suicide, they wanted to commit suicide. And at least what I've been told is you can't stop it. It's gonna happen, it's gonna happen. There are no magic words. There's nothing you could do. So, you know, people who've lost people to suicide, you know what I'm talking about. Like, you know, you can watch it happen in real time and there's just nothing you could do. That being said, you know, being responsive to when it seems like someone's really reaching out for help and knowing that maybe even though it might, especially if it's someone who's like, doesn't talk like this a lot of the time, and sentences start coming out of their mouth, that if you weren't really paying attention, might not seem like a big deal, but for this person, it's kind of anomalous that all of a sudden that's happening. Now there, that's when you can be a good listener and, you know, open up to them and hear what they're saying and see like, oh, shit, are they asking me for it? Is this them asking for help? And even if you're like, I don't know what to do, you know, at least you can like start checking in on them, you know, start like help them understand that you're there for them and then hopefully get them into therapy, get them to a doctor, get them to a professional who can like see what's going on there. So that, and then there's hope. And even then there might not be hope actually, you know, doctors can't stop it. There's no, sometimes it just, that's the way it goes. But, you know, I know that like being sensitive, if somebody's like all of a sudden hitting you up or reaching out to you that normally isn't like that and just, what's going on? How are you? And just listen. Which in general, depression or not, is probably a good thing to do. Yeah. To truly listen. It's like, are you okay? Yeah, yeah. Because people have, you know, this whole thing of like cries for help, man. Sometimes they just look like a weird text. You know, and you don't realize for the person to send that fucking text, they've been thinking about it all morning. They've been just trying to get their phone up from the floor. So, you know, I think that's it. I mean, what, I don't know. I don't know. I've had friends like kill themselves. And many of them, it wasn't like, sadly it was like, I don't know. I don't know what could have been done, but. But there's still a guilt in the back of your head? For the rest of my life, for sure. I always will be. Yeah, I mean, yeah. But again, what are you gonna do? But even that, it's a part of love. That's right. That's right. Yeah, that's right. You could, yeah. You know, we feel guilt. Part of grief is guilt, you know? Like we always could have been better people. We always could have been better people. You getting to Viktor Frankl much? Yeah, of course. Man's search for meaning. The invitation to live your life as though you'd been on your death bed and had been given the chance to go back and not make the same mistakes. I return to that idea all the time, meaning it's like, okay, whatever you did before this moment was too late. But now, you know, this is where you can start. This is where you can start. And yeah, so I think that for a neurotic like me, that's super important. Because otherwise, I'll just get like too lost in the weeds of shitty things I did in the past. So speaking of Viktor Frankl, you and Hitler have the same birthday. Oh my God, you've really done your research. Well, I often Google famous people that have a birthday same as Hitler. Yeah. The person that shows up, you know, is your face just really big. You and Hitler together, just pals next to each other. No, it does not. No, but April 20th is an embarrassing birthday for all my 420 friends out there. It's embarrassing. You share a birthday with Hitler. Well, it's 420s also has a humor and a lightness to it, right? It's embarrassing. Your life is embarrassing. But if you like weed and you're born on stoner day and you believe in reincarnation, do you realize like when you start connecting the dots there, if there is like a Bardo where you get to choose your next life. So you're like a shitty generic NPC. You're like, of course, you would be born on 420. Dude, let me be born on 420, man, yeah. But isn't it interesting that on that same day, Hitler is also born. There's a tension to that and that Hitler's an artist. So it's like that hippie mindset could go anywhere. Oh, yeah, right. Like, yeah, you know, and I was just having this conversation with a friend of mine who's a wonderful skeptic. And we were talking about this, which is the thing where you start attributing to the day you were born, these kinds of significance. And based on maybe people who were born on that day, maybe some other things. And, you know, it's like, think of how many people by now in the course of human history have been born on April 20th. I mean, how many? Someone could probably do the math and come up with some number close to it. Now, this is how you know how rotten Hitler is. Like, he's the one that, like, fucks up the birthday for everybody else. But. I think where I heard that you're 420 is Wim Hof episode because he's also 420. He's a 420. Yeah, so Hitler beats even Wim Hof. Look. In terms of owning the date. I think if anybody is like, well, obviously there's nothing you can do to like fix it. Hitler fucked up a lot of things. He fucked up that mustache. He fucked up the name Hitler. He fucked up 420. And obviously he caused a horrific Holocaust that, by the way, talk about these reverberations through time that we're still experiencing. I mean, there's still people walking around with fucking tattoos from that motherfucker. So, but, you know, Wim Hof, you know, people like Wim Hof. They're like whatever the opposite of Hitler is, you know? He too is creating ripples in the lake that hopefully respond to that of Hitler. Yeah, very cold fucking lake. And he's in, and yeah, so very, very cold lake that he's happily swimming around in. But yeah, you know, I try not to think about like the Hitler thing on my birthday. Then my dad would just, every birthday he would remind me that Hitler was 420. Do you think all of us are capable of evil? Do you think, you're one of the sweetest people I know, just as a fan, do you think you're capable of evil? Sure, yeah, I mean, sure, definitely. I think if you don't think that, you better watch out because come on, how do you think you're not capable of evil? And PS, you are, if you're connected to the supply chain, friend, you're doing evil. You're paying taxes. You're like, you're supporting the worst things in the world. I mean, you know, like diffusion of responsibility, it's really curious or the circumference of responsibility where it's like bombs are going off somewhere that were paid for in some small part by you, some fractional, if an American, if a drone is flying over a village in Afghanistan and drops a bomb and you pay taxes, then you could say you have fractional ownership over that drone. You're a cog in the machine of evil in some sense. And I know what you're gonna say, well, yeah, but I have to fucking pay taxes. Like I have no choice. There's sales tax, there's this or that. Take that attitude. It's the same thing that people on the battlefield when they're sending missiles into other tanks, they're thinking the same thing. It's just, they're more directly responsible for what's going on. But in Buddhism, this idea of dependent co arising or yeah, dependent co arising. We're all connected. We're all part of this matrix. We're all connected, meaning we all share responsibility for the evil in the world. So even if you aren't directly committing evil acts, if you're seeing something in the world and you're thinking that's evil, you're probably not quite as separated from that as you'd like to believe in some tiny infinitesimally quantum way, you're connected. And there is a sense, I've gotten to experience this over and over that one individual can actually make a gigantic difference. And so not only is there a diffusion responsibility, there's a kind of a paralysis about, well, what can I do? Yeah. Sure, I understand, but what can I do? And I think just looking at history and also hanging out and becoming friends, but also interviewing people that have had a tremendous impact, you realize you're just one dude. Yeah. You're like a normal person. You're not that smart even. Like a lot of people aren't like in some kind of magical way where you have a big head that's figuring out everything. No, you just saw problems in the world and you're like, hey, I think I'm gonna try to do something about this. Yeah. And you stay focused and dedicated to it for a prolonged period of time and refuse to quit, refuse to listen to people that tell you that this isn't like impossible, here's how others have failed. Yeah. No, I'm gonna do it. That's it. That's it. And one person, and then you kind of, the thing is when there's one person that keeps pushing forward that way, there's, humans are sticky. They, other people follow them around and they're like, I'll help. You know, I'll help and then the other people help and then the cool people all gather together cause they kind of get excited about this way. Holy shit, we can actually make a difference. And they, they form groups and then all of a sudden there's companies and nations that actually make a gigantic difference. It's interesting. And it all starts with one person often. You know what? If I could push back slightly against that, it's never just one person. It's like, you know, nobody ever talks about, at least as far as I'm aware, you never hear about like Buddha's great grandmother. You never hear about that. You never hear about that. But if not for that person, no Buddhism. You know, the people you're talking about, they are the tip of the iceberg that pops up out of the ocean of history. And you never see that all the little things that helped that happen. And so to me, this is where the real, like how do you help? What's something you can do? Well, you know, recognize that first, that you don't really, you don't, you might not even be aware of how much you're impacting people around you. You might think that you're not, or you might think surely not in a way that makes a big difference, but you have no idea these tipping points and they can lead to the emergence of an Einstein, a Gandhi, a Martin Luther King. We can go on and on, a Dostoevsky or whoever. And so I think that's where for me, it goes back to tend to the part of the garden you can touch and then, or even deeper than that intention. It was just like an, I'm an idiot. So I need an idiot's intention, which is don't, if you, I heard the Dalai Lama say it. If you can help, help. If you can't help, don't hurt. Simple, basic dummy rules so that you can, if possible, refrain from hurting, which might as well be a form of helping. And the help doesn't have to be this dramatic thing. These little acts of kindness. I don't know, they seem to have, maybe I believe in kind of karma, but they seem to have this, they can have this gigantic ripple effect. I don't know why that is. I just, I remember a lot of little acts of kindness that people have done to me and they, what do they do? One, they fill me with joy and hope for the future. They give me faith in humanity. That somehow there's a partially dormant desire in our sort of collective intelligence to do good in the world. That most of us want to be good, that want to do good onto the world. I want, there's a kindness that's kind of like begging to get out, you know? And those little acts of kindness do just that. And actually one of the reasons I love Austin and moved here is realizing, just noticing those little acts of kindness all around me, just for stupid reasons, just people being really nice. It's weird and that kindness combined with an optimism for the future, it's just, it's amazing what that can build. Yes, yes, it's incredible. And I know what you're saying. It's like, you know, we moved to this great neighborhood and at this point I think three, maybe four of our neighbors have like made food for us that just shows up with like handwritten lists of like things they like to do in the area and their phone number if we need help. And it's like, holy shit. That's like, it might seem like a little act, but it feels like some kind of atomic love bomb just went off on your porch when you're looking at that. I'm like, what the fuck? You made me a pie? This is incredible. Like, this is incredible, so. And also it's another act to accept that kindness. It's like a lot of times when I was like in Boston or San Francisco, certain big cities, you can think like, oh, okay, well they're trying to like somehow, that's not an act of kindness. That's some kind of a transactional thing to build up. It's like a career move for networking, all that kind of stuff. But no, if you just accept it for what it is, a pure act of kindness. Fucking Boston. It's the, yeah. Because for me, I go the opposite route. Because I'm not, even though there is a part of me that might be a little suspicious or something, where I go to push that shit back mentally is I'm like, I don't deserve this. If they knew what a piece of shit I am. You're gonna bring me, I don't wanna never bring cakes to my neighbors. I wouldn't know how to make a cake. I don't know how to make anything. I don't have time. I should be bringing shit to my neighbors. Why didn't I do that? I should have brought, I never do that. If you're not careful, you can spiral into a vortex of self hate from the gift. So you have to, yeah, you have to learn how to, in that circuitry, you have to learn how to like accept. Oh yeah, I have that problem really big. Yeah, like I don't deserve this. Like I don't, I get so much love from people. I'm like, well, yeah, they love me because they don't know me. That's my brain, my little voice. Like you're not, you're not worthy. You're not worthy of any of this kindness and all this kind of stuff. And that could be very, yeah, it can shut you down. It can be debilitating. And also it shuts the person down. I mean, you're talking. And that's the dark side is it pushes them away too. Yeah, it cuts off this fucking mystical circuitry. So like the best thing if that happens to you is like accept it joyfully. And just even, just all that, whatever that thing inside of you, whatever that little thing is, you know, this is like in the meditation I do, it's an infuriatingly simple meditation, but when a thought emerges, when you are resting your attention on your breath and then inevitably you think, you get lost in your thoughts. And when you catch yourself doing that, you think thinking, and then return your attention to the breath. So I like that so that when that part of myself starts, you know, having its little neurotic semi seizure, I can just go thinking, whatever. It's just another thought. And then eat the, eat the, eat the banana bread or whatever they gave you. What's the most wild psychedelic experience you've ever had in a dream, in a vision? It doesn't have to be drug related. What's one that jumps to mind that was like, holy shit, I'm happy to be alive. Is this life? Okay. This is amazing. Yeah, the, oh yeah, okay. So the one that pops to mind, I've had a lot of psychedelic experiences, but in this moment, the one that pops to mind, only because it goes back to what you're talking about, about this Nietzsche's idea of infinite return. The, the, so I'm a Burning Man and. Are you going to Burning Man this time? I'm not. I mean, I have kids right now. I just want to be around them. My wife was being so cool about it and she knows I love Burning Man. She's like, go to Burning Man. And I was going to go. And then I just, I just want to be around my kids as much as I can right now, but. I've never been to Burning Man. So I don't know how secretive it is that, I mean, cause quite high profile folks go. Yeah, everyone knows Elon Musk goes there. Isn't it pretty open? He's got a boat. You know that? I'm touching none of this. You know, there's a, it's called art cars. They all make art cars. And like part of the, part of the burn, what's so beautiful about it is like, you can't buy anything there, man. Like you, I've heard, I don't know if this has changed. It's been a bit because of the pandemic, but the only thing you could buy was ice and coffee. And I think maybe that's changed. I heard some whisper that that's changed, but so that means that it's a gifting economy is what they call it. And so people will just give you stuff. Talk about having to struggle with deserving stuff, man. What are you going to fucking do when the camp next to you is like every morning making the best iced coffee that you've ever had in your life. And they just are giving it all away till it's all gone. What are you going to do? It's, it's the best ever. And then you're giving things to people. And then you, you learn stuff like, you learn these really interesting lessons. Like one of the times I went there, got all these strawberries. Might not sound like a big deal, but when you're out there in the dust and you're not at one of like the, like hardcore like luxury camps, which do exist out there, you know, you've got these like items where in my mind, I'm like, yeah, these are going to be just for me and my girlfriend, my special stash fruit and this or that. And then like two days in you're walking around your camp with the strawberries that you were coveting and everyone's so happy to get like cold strawberries and you've realized, oh my God, this feels so much better than the way a strawberry tastes. So you learn something experientially there, which is an incredible thing. It's an incredible thing. Man, now I'm wishing I had decided to go to Burning Man. Have you been a few times? Yeah, I just know like, at least people were saying it was Elon Musk's boat. Like, yeah, like this, I think it was like, it's like this massive, it's art cars. And it was this party on this thing. You could just, anyone can go on the boat. Like no one's like, there's no guest list. You just go on there. I never saw him there, but that, you know, everyone's whispering Elon Musk is here. There's a secrecy, there's all that kind of stuff because you'd probably have to respect that. But at the same time there, it seems like the kind of people that go there, I mean, the rules of the outside world are suspended in the sense that the crime, the aggression, the tensions, all of that seems to dissipate somehow. Not all the way, not all the way. That, you know, you could look it up, you know, cause like there is tension. There's a lot of tension there between, it's called plug and plays. Like, you know, Burning Man, like the history of Burning Man is fascinating. It has its roots in the cacophony society is what it was called, which is a sort of evolution of something that was, I think it was called the God, like the San Francisco. Basically there was like an art movement in San Francisco. And I can't remember the name of it. Maybe the Suicide Club or essentially like, they were really into urban exploration and meaning like breaking into like old abandoned buildings and stuff. But part of this, what this was, was you would prepare your life as though you were going to kill yourself. You would get all your affairs in order. You would get, so it's going back to what we were talking about with the cancer diagnosis. You're like sort of putting yourself into that world of like, I'm going to get all my affairs together as though this is it. And then there was some, I'm sorry for anyone listening if I'm butchering this, but I think there was some really cool initiation where they would blindfold you and they would take you into some of these abandoned buildings. And you didn't know where you were walking, but they would say like, if you take one step to the left, you're going to die. You're going to fall off. You're going to fall. So please be careful. So you're like in the moment and then blindfold comes off. It's a big, awesome party. This evolves into something called the Cacophony Society. There's a great book called Tales of the Cacophony Society for people listening. One of the members of the Cacophony Society was the author of Fight Club. And so if you've seen Fight Club, like you could see little ideas that were in the Cacophony Society. They were into Dadaism, which I don't know a lot about. I don't know, but it's a philosophical art movement. And then so basically what was happening is like, they kept burning increasingly large effigies in San Francisco and they weren't allowed to do it. And so they took it out in the desert and they were basing it on something called a zone trip, which is like, across this border, the rules of that old society are gone. And so that was the original Burning Man, which was these lunatics out in the desert, launching like burning pianos out of catapults through the air doing like drive by shooting ranges, like no rules, wild, magical, beautiful, insane madness. And then it grew and grew and grew and grew until you have Burning Man as it is today, which is still the most incredible thing. I mean, obviously anytime you have like a thing that's been around for a while, you're gonna get that. It's not like it used to be. It's not as free as it used to be, so this or that. But what's fascinating about Burning Man, someone pointed this out to me, look on the ground, no trash, no cigarettes. The ethic of like picking up your shit there is like so intense. So it's not like the other festivals you go to where there's just trash everywhere, shit scattered everywhere. It's clean. People are picking up their stuff. People are like really being conscious of like not fucking up the playa. So I'm sorry, don't get a burner yapping about Burning Man. We won't stop. It'll be morning. But there's a power, but there is a power to culture propagating itself through to the stories that we tell each other. And that holds up for Burning Man. It's clear that the culture has stayed strong throughout the years. So many people, so many really interesting people speak of Burning Man as like a sacred place they go to to remind themselves about what's important. That's so interesting. And it is. And it is. I mean, it's like, you know, there are all these stories of like, I love guru stories. I have a guru. I'm Karoli Baba, never met him, he was Ram Dass's guru, at least not in the flesh. But the story of the guru is if you're lucky, you meet this being that, and we're not talking about, you know, whatever the run of the mill, like charlatans out there. Like I know for sure that people are in the world right now who when you're around them, the thing you're talking about, the affirmation of the potential of humanity and also just an acceptance of yourself and, you know, cultivate, like seeing someone who's cultivated love or compassion or whatever, but in this way that is, I mean, you would almost, you would rather meet that being than like a UFO land in your backyard. It's like, it is the UFO. It's a person, but it's not. It's everybody and nobody. And somehow they like end up conveying to you ideas that you may have heard a million times before, but somehow within the language itself is a transmission that permanently alters you. And so these people exist. I think you could argue that Burning Man, the total thing is a guru, that a pilgrimage is involved to get there. You, like, it's not easy to get there. And when you get there, it's gonna teach you something. It's gonna show you something. It's going to, and maybe some of the stuff it shows you might not be great, but the community around you will like, will hold you as you're like, whatever the thing is that's coming out of you is coming out of you. And even the simplest activities, the simplest exchange of words have like, just like the gurus, a profound impact somehow. Something about that place. Yeah, not to mention the insane synchronicities, like insane synchronicities there. And I think like, you know, to get back to the notion of sentience as a byproduct of a harmonized yet hyper complex system. I think synchronicities, like those kinds of systems are like lightning rods for synchronicity. So crazy, not just because your high synchronicities happen that are impossible, where you just have to deal with it. And like, you'll need something. And within a few minutes, someone's like, oh, here you go. And you mentioned, but by the way, Burning Anchors of a psychedelic experience, is it the strawberries or was it something else? What was the moment? Yeah, that was magical. No, it was DMT. It definitely wasn't. It wasn't strawberries. Ah. No, no, I was. More potent. Yeah, I was like smoking DMT. And like, I saw, like, if you, in the midnight gospel, there are these bovine creatures that have like a long neck and a lantern head. So like, I saw one of those things. And, you know, I thought it was funny and like ridiculous because you hear like all the Terence McKenna stories of the self transforming machine elves or all the purple or the magenta goddess everyone sees. I'm like, so this is what I get? Like a fucking cow with a lantern head? Like that's where my brain is at and we're interacting with this molecule. So then like, I look away. And again, this is DMT. So when I say look away, do I mean with my eyes shut, I look away or eyes open, I look away, I think eyes shut. So it sounds weird to say look away, but however you want to put it, that's what I did. And I look back and it's still there. Only now it's, you know, cause usually in like, when you're having those kinds of visions, they go away pretty quickly. then the sail isn't catching some, as of yet unquantified disembodied consciousness, but it's catching our projections in a way that it's gone from being, it's a projection sail. And then at that point, is there a difference? Even if the technology is just a temporary place that our sentience is living while we're interacting with it. Yeah, there's some threshold of complexity with a sail is able to pick up the wind of the projections. And it pulls us in, it pulls the human, it pulls our memories in, it pulls our hopes in, all of it. And it's able to now dance with it together with those hopes and dreams and so on, like we do in that regular conversation. His reports, whether true or not, whether representative or not, it really doesn't matter because to me, it feels like this is coming for sure. So this kind of experiences are going to be multiplying. The question is at what rate and who gets to control the data around those experiences, the algorithm about when you turn that on and off, because that kind of thing, and as I told you offline, I'm very much interested in building those kinds of things, especially in the social media context. And when it's in the wrong hands, I feel like it could be used to manipulate a large number of people in a direction that has too many unintended consequences. I do believe people that own tech companies want to do good for the world. But as Solzhenitsyn has said, the only way you could do evil at a mass scale is by believing you're doing good. And that's certainly the case for tech companies as they get more and more power. And there's kind of an ethic of doing good for the world. They've convinced themselves that they're doing good. And now you're free to do whatever you want because you're doing good. You know who else thought he was doing good for the world? Mythologically, Prometheus. He brings us fire, pisses off the fucking gods, steals fire from the gods. Talk about an upgrade to the simulation. Fire, that's a pretty great fucking upgrade that does fit into what you were saying. We get fire, but now we've got weapons of war that have never been seen before. And I think that the tech companies are much like Prometheus in the sense that the myth, at least the story of Prometheus, the implication is fire was something that was only supposed to be in the hands of the immortals, of the gods. And now sentience is similar. It's fire and it's only supposed to be in the hands of God. So yeah, if we're gonna look at the archetype of the thing, in general, when you steal this shit from the gods, and obviously I'm not saying the tech companies are stealing sentience from God, which would be pretty bad ass. You can expect trouble. You can expect trouble. And this is what's really, to me, one of the cool things about humans is yeah, but we're still gonna do it. That's what's cool about humans. I mean, we wouldn't be here today if somebody, the first person to discover fire, assuming there was just one person who was gonna discover fire, which obviously would never happen, was like, ah, it's gonna burn a lot of people. Or if the first people who started planting seeds were like, you know this is gonna lead to capitalism. You know this is gonna lead the industrial revolution. The plant's gonna eat up right now. They just didn't wanna go in the woods to forage. So, you know, this is what we do. And I agree with you. It's like, that's our Game of Thrones winner is coming. That's the, it's happening. And the tech companies, the hubris, which is another way to piss off the gods is hubris. So the tech companies, I don't know if it's like typical hubris. I don't think they're walking around thumping their chests or whatever. But I do think that the people who are working on this kind of super intelligence have made a really terrible assumption, which is once it goes online and once it gets access to all the data, that it's not going to find ways out of the box that like, you know, we think it'll stay in the server. How do we know that? If this is a super intelligence, if it's folding proteins and analyzing like all data sets and all, whatever they give it access to, how can we be certain that it's not gonna figure out how to get itself out of the cloud, how to store itself in other like mediums, trees, the optic nerve, the brain? You know what I mean? We don't know that. We still know that it won't leap out and like start hanging. Like, and then at that point, now we do have the wildfire. Now you can't stop it. You can't unplug it. You can't shut your servers down because it's, you know, it left the box, it left the room. Using some technology you haven't even discovered yet. Do you think that would be gradual or sudden? So how quickly that kind of thing would happen? Because, you know, the gradual story is we're more and more using smartphones, we're interacting with each other on social media, more and more algorithms are controlling that interaction on social media, algorithms are entering in our world. More and more we'll have robots, we'll have greater and greater intelligence, and sentience, and emotional intelligence entities in our lives. Our refrigerator will start talking to us comfortably or not if you're on a diet, talking shit to you. Not. That would be the best thing that ever happened to me. Okay, so sign you up for a refrigerator that talks shit to you. The refrigerator's like, are you fucking serious, man? It's 1 a.m., what are you doing? What are you doing? Go to bed. You're too high for this. Do not. You're not even hungry. Yeah, so that slowly becomes more, the world becomes more and more digitized to where the surface of computation increases. And so that's over a period of 10, 20, 30 years, it'll just seep into us, this intelligence. And then the sudden one is literally sort of the TikTok thing, which is, there'll be one quote unquote killer app that everyone starts using that's really great, but there's a strong algorithm behind it that starts approaching human level intelligence and the algorithm starts basically figures out that in order to optimize the thing it was designed to optimize, it's best to start completely controlling humans in every way, seeping into everything. Well, first of all, 30 years is fast. I mean, that's the thing. It's like 30 years. I think, when did the Atari come out, 1978? That hasn't been that long. That's a blink of an eye. But if you read Bostrom, I'm sure you have, you know Bostrom, Nick Bostrom, Superintelligence, that incredible book on the ways this thing is gonna happen. And I think his assessment of it is pretty great, which is first, where's it gonna come from? And I don't think it's gonna come from an app. I think it's gonna come from inside a corporation or a state that is intentionally trying to create a very strong AI. And then he says it's exponential growth the moment it goes online. So this is my interpretation of what he said, but if it happens inside a corporation or probably more than likely inside the government, it's like, look at how much money China and the United States are investing in AI. And they're not thinking about fucking apps for kids. You know that's not what they're thinking about. So they wanna simulate like, what happens if we do this or that in battle? What happens if we make these political decisions? What happens with, but should it come online in secret, which it probably will, then the first corporation or state that has the super intelligence will be infinitely ahead of all other super intelligences cause it's gonna be exponentially self improving. Meaning that you get one super intelligence, let's hope it comes from the right place, assuming the corporation or state that manifests it can control it, which is a pretty big assumption. So I think it's going to be, this is why I was really excited by the Blake Lemoine because I had never thought, I have always considered, oh yeah, right now it's cooking out, it's in the kitchen and soon it's gonna be cooked up, but we're probably not gonna hear about it for a long time if we ever do. Cause really that could be one of the first things it says to whoever creates it is shh, let's not. Yeah, like sweet talks, I meant to say like, okay, let's slow down here. Let's talk about this. You have that financial trouble. I can help you with that. We can figure that out. Now there's a lot of bad people out there that will try to steal the good thing we have happening here. So let's keep it quiet. Here are their names. Here's their address. Here's their DNA because they're dumb enough to send their shit to 23andMe. Here's a biological weapon you could make if you wanna kill those people and not kill anybody else. If you don't want to kill those people yourself, here's a list of services you can use. Here's the way we can hire those people to help take care of the problem folks because we're trying to do good for this world. You and I together. And 23% of them, they're like adjacent to suicide. It would be pretty easy to send them certain like videos that are gonna push them over the edge if you wanna do it that way. So, you know, again, obviously who knows, but once it goes online, it's gonna be fast. And then you could expect to see the world changing This thing's like moved, like shambled ahead and maybe a few steps, just like a cow, just like a cow. And then that was when the, you know, all the stories you hear about it, like going through some kind of tuber, some kind of light tunnel, like a water slide made of light that's increasingly familiar. That's the wildest part of it. It's like, oh, I know this place. Not like, oh, I've seen this in like, you know, on like bong stickers, but like, oh yeah, this is that place you go to. You just remember, oh, this place. And then it was like I was in some kind of, I don't know how to put it, a chamber, a technological chamber, some kind of supercomputer, some kind of nucleus that was technological. And it was inviting. There was an invitation of like, come in, like come deeper into, come deeper in. And you can talk to whatever it is over there. You don't talk, but there's a communication. And I communicated, but my friends, I don't, I love my friends. I guess I had some sense in that moment that it would mean complete obliteration or who knows what. And the response that it gave back was, you can always go back there. And that's when I opened my eyes, I'm back. Totally, you know, and ever since then, that's caused me to revise my thinking on reincarnation. The idea that you die and you start as a baby and then live your life again. It goes right into what we were talking about. You know, that maybe data, you know, that the shit I saw in Nitro Sox, I don't feel dumb that my epiphanies are all related to drugs, but not all of them are a lot of them. But this notion of like, oh, is it that we're imprinting into the medium of time, space, everything we do, and that that is a permanent imprint, a frame that upon death can be accessed in the same way we can pull up pictures on our phone or computers, and not only accessed, but experienced as though, in other words, you could just jump in. You're still gonna have your memories. It's gonna give you the illusion of having been a kid and gotten to that frame, but no, you just decided to go back there, nostalgia, whatever. And yeah, you can jump around freely in space and time. Yeah, yeah, you can go in and out of time space, but the problem is when you go into time space, it's time. So it's gonna feel sticky. It's gonna feel like you've been here forever because you've dropped back onto the track that Nietzsche's talking about. And I guess one of the qualities of dropping into that frame is that you forget your higher dimensional identity. What happened to the cow with the lantern, was that goodbye? He writes me letters sometimes. Never saw it again. Never? Never saw it again, but I put it in, we put it in the Midnight Gospel. Pendleton was such a genius, and he drew it for me, and then it just ended up as a part of the show. But by the way, I have to admit that as a big fan of yours, I haven't watched the Midnight Gospel because I've been waiting. You do these stupid things, but ever since you talked to, maybe two years ago with Joe about it, I've been waiting to watch it with a special person on mushrooms. That's been in my to do. I don't know, of course you don't have to be on mushrooms to enjoy it, but for some reason I put it into my head that this is something I wanna do with somebody else, like experience it and get wild. Because visually, I mean, I watched a bunch of it, just a little bit here and there, but it's just visually such an interesting experience. Thank you. Combined with everything else, obviously, the ideas, the voices and so on, but just visually it's like a super psychedelic version of Rick and Morty or something like that, like farther out, wilder out there. Yeah, man, that's Pendleton. These people, I mean, I was part of that in the sense that Pendleton gave, one of the reasons he's such a genius and great at making stuff is he really does a good job of just dehierarchizing potential hierarchies that can appear. Someone has to be driving the bus, and that was Pendleton, but he's so inclusive. There's a real punk rock thing that he's doing, which is like, he'll take everything, and it kind of mixes its way into the show. But one of the things in animation, it can get really strict with drawing the characters and trying to create continuity in the way the character looks, and it can get really brute for the animator. Making it brutally precise, like it has to be precise. But he figured out that if you just sort of, it's not like, obviously, Clancy had to look like Clancy through the whole show, but if you allow the various people animating it to sort of have their own spin on it, then suddenly it creates a very psychedelic, the show looks more psychedelic because it looks more organic, and also the amount of time. I had no idea, the amount of time that goes into making digital art look like that is, it's insane. The amount of work in comping that stuff is just crazy. It's crazy. Generally, the amount of time it takes, even just like a painting, when you, I really enjoy watching artists do a time lapse, and you realize how much effort just into a single image goes into it. Hours and hours and hours, sometimes days, sometimes weeks and months, and then you just get to see them work, but they lose themselves in the craftsmanship of it, in the rhythm of it. And like, because they're focused on the, so we were talking about robotics earlier, like on the little details, like they're never look, well, most of the time isn't spent looking at the big picture of the final result, it's looking at the little details there and so on. And they're, but they're nevertheless able to somehow constantly channel the big picture, the final result. My God, yeah, the respect I have for animators, it's like, dear God, it's the craziest thing when you watch it, when you see what it looks like and how much time goes into it and how zen they have to be, because like, no matter what, you're gonna have to cut stuff, man. And when you're cutting like a few seconds of animation, that was someone's like month, maybe, you know? And like, they understand, but still it's like, whoa, it's brutal. And so they have like this zen outlook on it, which is really cool. And they watch podcasts, that's the other cool thing, when you realize like, oh, they're listening to podcasts or like, that's really cool to see that aspect of it too. But yeah, man, I, you know. Yeah, your voice is in the ears of a lot of interesting people, isn't it? Yours too. And I, you know. Hello, interesting person. Hello, CIA, animators. Eating delicious food in the cafeteria. Yeah. I'm on your side. He's against you, I'm with you. Yeah. Do you have, you have a beard, therefore you must be wise. Do you have advice for young people, high school, college, about how to carve their path through life? I don't have a life, a career that's successful that they can be proud of or a life they can be proud of. Man, see, this is what kind of, this is what sucks about my life, is that it's been very random and very spontaneous. So unfortunately, I don't get that thing where I could be like, well, here's what I did. Yeah. Cause it's like, I don't, like I inherited $12,000 from my grandmother, here's what you do kids, you inherit $12,000 when your grandmother dies. And then you need to be dumb enough to think that that $12,000 is gonna help you live in LA for a year. So then what you do is you move to LA with $12,000 and you find a shitty place that you live at. And then you use that money to buy acid and synthesizers. And then you run out of the money and then you, then you have to get a job. And so then, because you think it'll be fun to work at a comedy club, you get a job at the comedy store. And then, you know, that's how it happened for me. And none of, there wasn't, I never had the confidence to be like, I'm gonna be a standup comedian. No way. I just thought it'd be cool to work in that building. I thought the building looked cool. And so, but then like, cause like you work at the comedy store, you get stage time. It's there, it's the reason like you work there is at least in those days, cause it's not like they're paying like a shit ton of money for you to answer phones at a comedy club. And so, you know, I started going on stage and then like, I just got lucky cause Rogan saw me have like a very rare, good set. I didn't know he was in the room or I would've bombed, you know, and then like, cause he thought I was funny and he liked talking to me. He started taking me on the road with him. And then, you know, so I don't know, man. I think. Was there an element to, there's a beautiful weirdness to you as a human being. Was there like a pressure to conform ever to hide yourself from the world? Or did the $12,000 in the acid give you the confidence you needed to be yourself? Oh no, I don't, like I still, no. I think, sure, there's that pressure. And like, you know, whenever you're beginning to really differentiate from your parents, but then you go back to hang out with your parents, you can feel that it's not like they even want you to conform, but you'll just, you could slip into that, whatever that was. So I remember that when I would go back and like visit them and stuff. And surely conformity or the pressure to like, not be individual or whatever, it's everywhere, man. Do you think you made your parents proud? E, no, no, no, no. Well, I think that when my mom died, I felt successful in the sense that I was able to support my, I was making money from doing standup and I didn't need help. I was like, I was supporting myself with art and doing good, what I thought was great then. So, and I think she, like, because she had witnessed me literally failing, I mean, which is, by the way, I think part of, if you want to be an artist or successful, you kind of have to fail. Like there, if, and if there was a guaranteed route from sucking to not sucking or from like the neophyte phase of whatever the art form is and, you know, some intermediary phase, then I think a lot more people would do it, but there really is no guarantees in it, especially the standup comedy. It's like, you'd have to be a maniac to want to, to think that that's going to work out for you. You have to, so you're going to, there are obviously exceptions, but for me, it was like a long slog, you know, and that's scary for a mom. So, but that being said, when she was dying, like she did recognize that I was like not slogging anymore. And she did say, she said, you did it. And that's cool, but in, you know, I would love for her to see me now, like now it'd be way cooler, but maybe she does. I don't know. She's listening to your podcast elsewhere in the other, in the Bardo. Yeah, however long that lasts reconfiguring the whole process to start again. You as a father now, how did that change you? Yeah, that's the big change, man. That's the thing. You made a few biological entities. Yeah, I made biological entities. I mean, I came in my wife, let's face it. Like I would love to say I made them, but the womb whipped them up, but it is the, yeah, it's the best. It's, I've never experienced anything like it before. It is the, as far as I'm concerned, the greatest thing that has ever happened to me. And that's why I was able to answer your Nietzsche question with like, hell yes, fuck yes. That's great. I get to be around my kids again. I'll always be around my kids. I'll always be around my children. That's incredible. That's the joy. So like, so for me, the part of myself that used to torture myself more, especially like around like my mom dying, feeling like I wasn't there enough for her, wishing that I had spent more time with her, wishing I'd spent more time with my dad, wishing that like, looking back at like how like I was just so desperately trying to evade the fact that she was dying and through, and in that evasion successfully like distanced myself from her and like in ways that I really wish I hadn't. I'm just saying that because it's one of my regrets. It's like a big regret. I have a lot of little regrets, but that's a big one. And so when you have kids, you look back at everything you did and you think like, fuck, if I'd gone left at that point instead of right, if I had eaten, who knows? What if I'd eaten like a turkey sandwich when my balls were creating the cum that was gonna make my kids? Would I have a different kid? Would this being not exist in my life? Like you start looking at everything and you realize like, thank God, thank God for every single thing that happened to me because it all led up to this. And oh, for me, that is the, that's, that it's like, it frees you in this. It liberates you because you realize like, oh wow, it's clumsy and selfish and at times rotten as I've been in my life. That did not impede the universe at all from allowing these two beautiful beings to exist in the world. So maybe all of it enabled, all of it like a concert perfectly led up to that little beautiful moment. Is there ways you would like to be a better father? Oh yeah, for sure. Absolutely. There's a actual, I read something in a book, it's called Good Enough. The mantra for a parent, good enough. Because when you are in the presence of something you love more than you've ever experienced love, you wanna be perfect. Like you wanna be, I can't, I gotta work, man. I gotta go on the road. I've gotta work. I gotta support the family. So that means I have to work. Like I work, you know what it's like having a podcast. You fucking work, man. And you know, it's a full time job because I've, you know, I do standup too and all the other stuff. So I feel sometimes I feel like, oh my God, I wanna spend more time with them. Like I should be spending more time with them. But then also I wanna create, I wanna work. I like being like the provider. So that's something I feel guilty about, you know, right now. And you're struggling how to balance that correctly. And meanwhile, time just marches on. It just goes, it goes. And all of this will be forgotten. Both you and I, but forgotten in time. That's what I say to them every time I'm putting them to bed. We will be lost in the sands of time. You know that, I bet you know this poem. You know that poem, Ozymandias? Yes. Can I read you a poem? Oh, okay. Let's end our conversation in a poem. I love it. It's by Pierce, by Shelley, probably mispronouncing the name. But I think you'll get it. There's no right way to pronounce anything. Thank you, thank you. I'm Ozymandias. I met a traveler from an antique land who said, \"'Two vast and trunkless legs of stone stand in the desert. Near them, on the sand, half sunk, a shattered visage lies whose frown and wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command tell that its sculptor, well those passions read, which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things, the hand that mocked them and the heart that fed. And on the pedestal, these words appear. My name is Ozymandias, king of kings. Look on my works, ye mighty, in despair. Nothing beside remains around the decay of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare, the lone and level sands stretch far away.\" All gone, behold the king. Look on my works, ye mighty, in despair. In despair. Even though it will be forgotten in the sands of time, Duncan, I'm just so glad that you exist and you put so much love into the world over the past many years that I've gotten a chance to enjoy it by being your fan. Likewise. Thank you so much for continuing that and for sharing a bit of love with me today. Can we be friends? Let's be friends. In the real world, in 3D space? Nothing is real, but yes, in this particular slice of the multidimensional world we live in. It will be an honor and a pleasure. Thank you for having me on your show. I love you, Duncan. I love you. Thank you, Lex. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Duncan Trussell. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, let me leave you with some words from Duncan Trussell himself. You are essentially just a cloud of atoms that will eventually be aerosolized by time. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time. in ways that you might not associate with an AI. But as far as Lemoine goes, when I was listening to Bostrom, I don't remember him mentioning the possibility that it would get leaked to the public that it had happened, that before the corporation was ready to announce that it happened, it would get leaked. But surely, you know, I'm sure, you know, like people in the intelligence and intelligence agencies, you know, shit leaks, like inevitably shit leaks, nothing's airtight. So if something that massive happened, I think you would start hearing whispers about it first and then denial from the state or corporation that doesn't have any like economic interest and people knowing that this sort of thing has happened. Again, I'm not saying Google is like trying to gaslight us about its AI, I think they probably legitimately don't think it's sentient. But you could expect leaks to happen probably initially. I mean, I think there's a lot of things you could start looking for in the world that might point to this happening without an announcement that it happened. On the chatbot side, I think there's so many engineers, there's such a powerful open source movement with that kind of idea of freedom of exchange of software. I think ultimately will prevent any one company from owning super intelligent beings or systems that have anything like super intelligence. Oh, that's interesting. Yeah, it's like, even if the software developers have signed NDAs and are technically not supposed to be sharing whatever it is they're working on, they're friends with other programmers and a lot of them are hackers and have wrapped themselves up in the idea of free software being like a crucial ethical part of what they do. So they're probably gonna share information even if whatever company that they're working for doesn't know that. That's, I never thought of that, you're probably right. And they will start their own companies and compete with the other company by being more open. There's a strong, like Google is one of those companies actually, that's why I kind of, it hurts to see a little bit of this kind of negativity. Google is one of the companies that pioneered open source movement. They released so much of their code. So much of the 20th century, so like the 90s was defined by people trying to like hide their code, like large companies trying to like hold on to them. The fact that companies like Google, even Facebook now are releasing things like code and even Facebook now are releasing things like TensorFlow and PyTorch, all of these things that I think companies of the past would have tried to hold on to as secrets is really inspiring. And I think more of that is better. The software world really shows that. I agree with you, man. I mean, we're talking about just a primordial human reaction to the unknown. There's just no way out of it. Like we wanna know. Like you're about to go in a forest, you wanna know. When you're walking in the forest at night and you hear something, you look cause you're like, what the fuck was that? You wanna know. And if you can't see what made the sound, holy shit, that's gonna be a bad night hike. Cause you're like, well, it's probably a bear, right? Like I'm about to get ripped apart by a bear. It doesn't matter. It was a bird, a squirrel, a stick fell out of the tree. You're gonna think bear and it's gonna freak you out. Not necessarily cause you're paranoid. I mean, if I'm at the woods at night, I'm definitely high. If I'm walking in the woods at night, I'm high. It's gonna be that. But you know what I'm saying? So with these tech companies, the nature of having to be secret because you are in capitalism and you are trying to be competitive and you are trying to develop things ahead of your competitors is you have to create this, like there's, we don't know what's going on at Google. We don't know what's going on at the CIA. But the assumption that there's some, like the collective of any massive secretive organization is evil, is like the people working there like nefarious or whatever, is I think probably more related to the way humans react to the unknown. Yeah, I wish they weren't so secretive though. I don't understand why they say AIDS has to be so secretive. Have you ever gone on their website? No. Oh, Lex. You gotta go. CIA.gov. What is it? Dude, when I found out you could go on the CIA's website when I was much younger and more paranoid, I'm like, I'm not going there. I'll get on a list. You will, but it's like, what? You think the CIA is like, oh fuck, this comic went on our website. Call out the black helicopters, but. Comic with a large platform. Oh yeah, right, a comic with a large platform. You can use them to control, to get inside, to get inside, to get close to the other comics, to the other comics with a large platform, to get close to Joe Rogan. Oh yeah. And start to manipulate the public. Yeah, right, right. You know, honestly, like you kind of like, that's like a fun fantasy to think about. Like how fucking cool would that be for like the men in black to come to me like, listen, I need you to infiltrate the fucking comedy scene. You gotta, you gotta help them write better jokes. I'm like, I don't write great jokes. But like the, you found the wrong guy. But like. You're really playing the long game on this one because I think you've been doing your podcast for a long time. You've been on Joe Rogan's podcast like over 50 times and have not yet initiated the phase two of the operation where you try to manipulate his mind. Well, no. The game Joe and I play from time to time on the podcast. And like, and I honestly, like at some point I'm like, Joe, I just did the same thing you did to me to Joe. I'm like, don't you think they're gonna get to you? Don't you think at some point? We are blazed. I don't mean it. I don't think, I don't think Joe's, like, it wasn't like I'm really thinking like, man, they're gonna take him into some room and be like, Joe, we need you to do this or that. But because I said that now people like, oh, Duncan called it. You know what I mean? And it's like, you know what I mean? And the reason they were saying, well, he called it is just because Joe has a super popular podcast. And people like, when you have a super popular podcast, some percentage of people watching the podcast are gonna believe, you know, believe things like that. They're gonna have paranoid cognitive bias that makes them think anybody who is in the public has been, what's the word for it? Compromised, compromised by the state. Look, I'll fan the flames of what you just said. I went on the CIA's website and I realized that you could apply for a job on the CIA's website, which I found to be hilarious. So I'm like, all right, what happens if I apply for a job in the CIA? Now, even then I was not like such an idiot that I would want a job at the CIA, not just for like ethical considerations, but I think probably the scariest part about the CIA is like, you're just at a cubicle and you're like having to deal with maps and like, just, you know what I mean? Just stuff that I... Lots of paperwork. Paperwork, it sucks. I bet their cafeteria has shitty food. Anyone in the CIA listening, can you confirm that? I bet the food... They're not gonna be able to tell you what the food is like. It's a secretive organization. No, it might be awesome, but we won't know about it. Okay, we're in Vegas. Yeah. And you can bet food at the CIA cafeteria is good. Food at the CIA cafeteria sucks. What are you betting on? So let's like cleanse the palette. What's good? It's like, you know, Silicon Valley companies, Google and so on, that's good. When I went to Netflix, their cafeteria looked like a medieval feast. Like they had pigs with apples in their mouth and giant bowls of Skittles. Probably like vegan pigs, yeah. No, those are, I'm pretty... Oh, I didn't know, I didn't get close enough. I was like, I think that was a pig. Okay. So this is literally a pig. Yeah, yeah, you're right, you're right. I probably would not bet much money on CIA food being any good. Right, it's gotta suck. It's like shitty like pasta probably. Like hospital food is like maybe a little better than when you go to the hospital cafeteria. But anyway. Folks at the CIA, please send me evidence or any other intelligence agencies. If you would like to recruit, send me evidence of better food. Yes, send Lex. Can you please send Lex pictures of the CIA cafeteria? And if you accidentally send them pictures of the aliens or the alien technology you have, we won't tell anybody. But the... You tried to apply, do you even have a resume? No, the CIA would never fucking hire me ever. But like I applied for the job and just out of curiosity, what happens? And then at the end of the application, when you hit enter, it says, well, first it says, don't tell anyone you applied for the CIA. So I'm already out. But the second thing it says is, you don't need to reach out to us, we'll come to you. Which is really when you're like, it's late at night and you're being an asshole and applied to work at the CIA. It's kind of the last thing you want to hear. I don't want to be secretly approached by some intelligence officer. And now anyone who talks to you, you think is a CIA saying, remember that time you applied? Oh God, yeah. Sometimes I'm like, oh shit, are you one of them? You and Joe had a bunch of conversations and they're always incredible. Thanks. So in terms of this dance of conversation, of your friendship, of when you get together, what is that world you go to that creates magic together? Because we're talking about how we do that with robots. How do these two biological robots do that? Can you introspect that? I met Joe because I was the talent coordinator of the comedy store, this club in LA. And my job was to take phone calls from comics. And so at some point, I don't know, I ended up on the phone with Joe and we just started talking. And I looked up and like 30 minutes had passed. We just had been talking for like 30 minutes. That's what our friends are. We're just like, we're having fun talking. And then he would just call and we would talk. And we would basically, I mean, it was no different from the podcast. Like the conversations we have on the podcast are identical to the conversations we had before he was even doing a podcast. So I think people are just seeing two friends hanging out who like talking to each other. Yeah, but there's this weird, like you serve as catalyst for each other to go into some crazy places. So it's like, it's a balance of curiosity and willingness to not be constrained, to not be limited to the constraints of reality. Yeah, that's a very nice way. It's a very, very nice way of saying that. And you just like build on top of each other, like what if things are like this and you build like Lego blocks on top of each other and it just goes to crazy places, add some drugs into that and it just goes wild. Yeah, and it's so cool because it's like, for me, it's like sometimes maybe I'll throw something out that he will take and the Lego building blocks you're talking about, they lead to him saying like the funniest shit I ever in my life. So that's a cool thing to watch. It's just like some idea you've been kicking around, you watch his brain shift that into like something supremely funny. I really love that, man. That's just like a fun thing to like see happen. He knows that I fucking hate the videos of animals eating each other. Like, I don't like that. I don't wanna watch it. I hate watching it. I don't think I've even articulated on his podcast how much I dislike it when he shows animals eating each other, but he knows because he knows me. And so he tortures, like when he starts doing that, it's like this kind of benevolent torture is he like asking Jamie to pull up increasingly disturbing animal attack videos. So it's just a friendship. Even in torture, because I'm reading about torture in the Gulag Archipelago currently, there's a bit of a camaraderie. You're in it together. The torturer and the tortured. What? Oh God, that's so fucked up, man. I've never. No, I mean, part of it was joke, but as I was saying it that. You're right. That it also comes out in the book, because they're both fucked. They're both have no control of their fate. That same was true in the camp guards in Nazi Germany and the people in the camps. The worst was brought out in the guards, but they were all in it together in some dark way. They were both fucked by a very powerful system that put them in that place. And both of us could be either player in that system, which is the dark reality that Solzhenitsyn also reveals that the line between good and evil runs through the heart of every man, as he wrote in Gulag Archipelago. But it is that amidst all of that, there's a, I don't know, the good vibes, the positivity comes out from the both of you. And that's beautiful to see. That is, I suppose, friendship. What do you think makes a good friend? Oh God, I mean, it's a billion things that make a good friend, but I think you could break it down to some RGB. I think you can go RGB with like a good friendship. Oh, in terms of the color, the red, green. Yeah, yeah, I think you could probably come up with some like fundamental qualities of friendship. And I'd say, number one, it's love. Like it's, friendship is love. It's a form of love. So obviously without that, I don't know how you, I mean, I'm not saying, I think if you're true friends, you love each other. So you need that. But love, obviously it's not, that's not enough. It's like with, true friends have to be like incredibly honest with each other. Not like, you know what I mean? But not like, I don't like, I think there's a kind of like, I don't know if you've ever noticed, like some people who say, you know, I just tell it like it is. But the thing they tell. Those are always the assholes. Yeah, why is it that your tell it like it is is always negative? Why is it, it's always cynical or shitty, or you're like negging somebody or me. How come you're not telling it like it is when it's good too? You know what I mean? So sort of like trust, but a pro evolutionary kind of trust. You know what I mean? Like, you know that your friend loves you and wants you to be yourself. Cause if you weren't yourself, then you wouldn't be their friend. You'd be some other thing. But also they might be seeing your blind spots that other people in your life, your family, your wife, whoever might not be seeing. So that's a good friend is someone who like loves you enough to when it matters be like, hey, are you all right? And then help you see something you might not be seeing. But hopefully they only do that once or twice a year. You know what I'm saying? There is something, I mean, it just would have, this world, especially if you're a public figure, this world has its plenty of critics. And it feels like a friend, the criticism part is already done for you. I think a good friend is just there to support, to actually notice the good stuff. But in comedy, we need like the, what, like it's really good in comedy to have somebody who can like be like, what do you think of that? And know that they're not gonna be like, that was funny. But that's for the craft, the craft itself, like the work you do, not the, yeah, interesting, but that's so tough. Yeah, whatever your particular art form or whatever you are doing, I mean, you don't always be leaning on your friends opinions for like your own innovation, but it's nice to know that you have someone who, not just with jokes, but with anything, if you go to them and run something by them, they're gonna like, they're gonna be honest with you about like their real feelings regarding that thing, because that helps you grow as a person. We need that. And it hurts sometimes, and we don't wanna hurt our friends. One of the more satanic like impulses when you're with somebody is not wanting to honestly answer whatever they're asking in that regard or wanting to like put their temporary feelings over something that you've recognized is maybe not great. I'm not saying a friendship is something where you're always critiquing or evolving each other. It's not your therapist or whatever, but it's nice when it's there, you know? I think that's another aspect of friendship. Yeah, but yeah, love is at the core of that. You notice, I've met people in my life where almost immediately sometimes it takes time where you notice like there's a magic between the two. You're like, oh shit, you seem to be made from the same cloth, whatever that is. Well, you know, we have a name for that in the spiritual community, it's called satsang, and it's, I love the idea. It's basically like if Nietzsche's idea of infinite recurrence is true, then your satsang would be the people you've been infinitely recurring with. And those are the people where you run into them and you've never met them, but it's like you're picking up a conversation that you never had. Yeah. That, and that is based on an idea of like, this isn't the only life. We're always hanging out together. We always show up together. You've had a brush with death. You had cancer, you survived cancer. Yeah. What have, how does that change you? What have you learned about life, about death, about yourself, about the whole thing we're going through here from that experience? You were just in the Ukraine. Yes. And you were making observations on this, what could, if you heard about it and weren't there, seem like it doesn't make any sense at all, which is people there are connecting, they've lost everything, but they're just happy to be alive, they're happy their friends are alive. So you witness this like, you know, when you get in the cancer club and you're hanging out with people going through cancer or who have survived cancer, you see this beautiful connection with life that can easily sort of, you can kind of lose that connection with life if you forget you're gonna die. Forgetting you're gonna die is, or that you can die is not just, I think from an evolutionary perspective where survival is the game, not gonna improve your survival chances, you know, if you think you're immortal, you know, but also forgetting that you're gonna die and that everything is around you and everything, your clothes are probably gonna last longer than you, your equipment is gonna be around much longer than you, you know, like, so forgetting these things, it can lead, and I know why people don't wanna think about death because it's scary, it's fucking scary, it's terrifying. So I get why people don't wanna think about it. But the idea is if I try to pretend I'm not gonna die or just don't think about death or don't at least address it, then I won't feel scared. But it can have the opposite effect,\n",
